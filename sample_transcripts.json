How can I assist you today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Hi, um, yeah, I was involved in this accident, and I think I might need some help."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m sorry to hear that. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Sure, it was, like, on May 26th, I think? I was in Seattle, um, at this grocery store, and I slipped on some... well, it was, like, spilled juice or something."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really uncomfortable. So, you slipped in the grocery store\u2014did you see if there were any warning signs or if the spill had been there for a while?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, no, there weren't any signs. I mean, I guess it was there for a bit, but, um, I didn't really pay attention. I just, like, lost my balance and fell."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I understand. It\u2019s easy to miss those things in the moment. Were there any employees nearby when you fell? Did anyone come to help you right away?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, um, a couple of employees came over. They helped me get up, but, like, they didn\u2019t really do much else. Just asked if I was okay, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it. So, after the fall, did you seek any medical attention?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I went to the hospital later that day. My back and, like, my wrist really hurt. They did some X-rays and stuff, but, um, they didn\u2019t find any fractures, just some sprains and strains."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m sorry to hear about your injuries. It\u2019s important to keep track of any medical records related to this. Have you had any follow-up appointments since then?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, yeah, I went back a couple of times for physical therapy. But it\u2019s, like, been really hard to do everyday stuff now, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds tough. So, it seems like your injuries have impacted your daily life. Can you tell me if you missed work because of this?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I had to take, like, two weeks off, but I\u2019m back now. It was a struggle, though, \u2018cause I work as a delivery driver, and, um, lifting boxes and stuff was really hard with my wrist."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That must have been frustrating for you. Have you been able to get any documentation from your employer about your missed work?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, yeah, I think I have something from them. I can check."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great. That\u2019ll help us understand the impact better. Now, regarding the grocery store\u2014do you happen to know if they have insurance? Did you exchange any information with them?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I think they have insurance? I didn\u2019t really talk to them about it, but, like, the employees said they\u2019d file a report. I didn\u2019t get any of their info, though."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, that\u2019s helpful to know. Sometimes, they have their own insurance that will cover these types of incidents. Have you spoken to anyone else about this, like another attorney or anything?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, no one else. I just, like, thought I\u2019d call you guys first."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s perfectly fine. We\u2019re here to help. Now, just to clarify, have you ever had any previous injuries or medical issues that might relate to your back or wrist?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, yeah, I mean, I did hurt my wrist a while ago, but it was, like, years ago. It wasn\u2019t a big deal, you know? I just kind of tweaked it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thanks for sharing that. It\u2019s good to have a complete picture. Since this injury is recent, we\u2019ll focus on that. Now, if you don\u2019t mind me asking, have you ever had any legal issues in the past?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Well, um, I did get arrested a few years back, but that\u2019s, like, all behind me now. I just\u2014uh, it was a misunderstanding, really."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I appreciate your honesty. It\u2019s important for us to have all the details. Alright, so just to summarize the key points: You slipped in a grocery store in Seattle on May 26th, you sustained injuries to your back and wrist, you missed work for two weeks, and you haven\u2019t consulted with any other attorney yet. Is that correct?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, that sounds about right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Perfect. The next step is for me to pass this information along to one of our attorneys. They\u2019ll review your case and reach out to you soon. Just to let you know, we work on a contingency fee basis, which means you don\u2019t pay unless we win your case."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Okay, that sounds good. Thanks for explaining that."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "No problem at all! If you have any other questions in the meantime, feel free to ask. Otherwise, you can expect a call from us soon."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Alright, thanks, Carlos. I appreciate your help."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "You\u2019re welcome! Take care, and we\u2019ll be in touch soon."}], "outcome_status": "settled", "outcome_value": 45000}

How can I help you today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, hi. I, um, I need to talk about an accident I had, uh, last Christmas."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Of course! I'm sorry to hear you were in an accident. Could you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, so, um, I was at home, and I was trying to, like, use this new blender I got as a gift. It, um, exploded or something? Like, it just, it didn't work right and, you know, there was stuff everywhere."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really frustrating! I'm glad you\u2019re okay. So, just to clarify, you were using a blender, and it malfunctioned. Did you suffer any injuries from that incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh, yeah, for sure. I got, um, some cuts on my hands from the glass and, uh, I think I might have, like, sprained my wrist trying to catch it before it fell. It was, um, really messy."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds painful! How severe were those injuries? Did you need to seek medical attention?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I went to the ER because, um, my wrist was hurting a lot. They, like, gave me a splint and some pain meds. I was in a lot of pain for a few weeks, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really tough. So, it sounds like you had significant injuries. Did you happen to keep any records of your medical visits or treatments?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I think I have the, like, the hospital discharge papers somewhere. I didn\u2019t really think about it until now, but, uh, I guess it's important, right?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Yes, having those records will definitely help. Now, about the blender\u2014do you know the brand or where it was purchased?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, I think it was, um, some brand called, like, Blendy or Blendex? I\u2019m not, um, totally sure. I just remember it was from one of those online stores."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it. And did you, um, report this incident to the manufacturer or the seller at all?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, no, not really. I just, like, cleaned it up and tried to forget about it. I didn't think, um, it would matter much."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s understandable. It can be overwhelming after an incident like that. Now, did you get any insurance information related to the blender? Like, do you know if it\u2019s covered by any warranty or anything?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I think it had a warranty? But I didn\u2019t check what it was. I just, like, saved the box and stuff. I\u2019m not sure if that helps."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "It might! It's definitely worth looking into. Now, just to confirm, you mentioned you were injured, and you went to the ER. Have you had any follow-up visits or ongoing treatments since then?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, yeah, I went back a couple of times for the wrist, but, like, not much else. They said it would heal but, um, it still kinda hurts, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I understand. Chronic pain can be really difficult to deal with. Have you had any other expenses related to this injury, like physical therapy or missed work?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh, yeah! I, um, missed a couple of weeks at work, and my boss wasn\u2019t, like, super happy about it. I think I lost, um, some money because of that."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m really sorry to hear that. It sounds like it\u2019s been quite a burden. Just to clarify, do you have any other representation or lawyers currently working on this case?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, no, I don\u2019t. I was, like, just thinking about it, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s good to know! Now, based on what you\u2019ve shared, it seems like you have significant injuries and some potential product liability issues. I\u2019ll pass this information to one of our attorneys who will review it and get back to you. They will follow up with you to discuss the next steps."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Okay, that sounds good. Um, what happens now?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "After I gather all this information, our attorney will review your case more closely and, um, they might reach out to you for additional details or to discuss potential legal options. Just so you know, we work on a contingency fee basis, so you won\u2019t owe any fees unless we win your case."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh, that\u2019s good to know. I was, like, worried about costs."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I totally understand. It\u2019s a common concern. Just to wrap up, can you confirm your name and the best way to reach you?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, it\u2019s, um, Jamie Carter, and you can reach me at my cell, it's, uh, 555-123-4567."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! Thank you, Jamie. I\u2019ll make sure our attorney gets this information. Is there anything else you want to ask or discuss today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I think that's it. Thanks for your help!"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "You\u2019re welcome! I appreciate you sharing your story with me. We\u2019ll be in touch soon.

How can I help you today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, hi\u2014yeah, I, uh, I was in a car accident a little while ago, and I\u2019m just trying to figure out what to do next."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m really sorry to hear that you were in an accident. I\u2019d be happy to help gather some information. Can you tell me when the accident happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, it was on June 21st, uh, 2023."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it. And where did the accident occur?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "In Boston, Massachusetts."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thanks for that. Can you walk me through what happened in the accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Sure, um, I was driving, and I had a green light, and then this other car just, like, ran the red light and crashed into me."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really scary. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re okay. Were there any witnesses to the accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, there were a couple of people around who saw it, um, they even came over to check on me."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s good to hear. Witnesses can really help in these situations. Did you exchange insurance information with the other driver?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, yeah, I got their insurance info, but I don\u2019t remember the company name, um. I think it was, uh, something like\u2026 State something?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s alright! We can figure that out later. Did you need to file a police report?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, the police came and, um, they took a report. I think it was filed under my name."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Perfect. That documentation can be really helpful. Now, can you tell me about any injuries you sustained from the accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh, yeah. I, um, I had, like, significant injuries. I hit my neck and back pretty hard. I\u2019ve been dealing with, uh, pain since then."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I'm sorry to hear that you're in pain. Have you sought medical treatment for those injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uhh, not right away. I didn\u2019t go to the hospital immediately. I thought it was just a sprain, but then, like, a week later, I couldn\u2019t move my neck. So, I went to a doctor."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "It sounds like you had to delay treatment, which can be tough. What did the doctor say about your injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "They, um, said I have some muscle strain and maybe some nerve issues. I also have, like, pre-existing back problems, so they\u2019re not sure how much is from the accident."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That makes sense. It\u2019s common for pre-existing conditions to complicate things. Have you had any physical therapy or additional treatments since then?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I started physical therapy a few weeks ago, and it\u2019s been, um, really helpful, but it\u2019s still painful."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I can understand how frustrating that must be. Have you missed any work because of your injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, yeah. I\u2019ve missed, like, three weeks so far. I work as a, um, graphic designer, so it\u2019s been hard to, like, sit at my desk for long."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really challenging. Have you been able to keep track of any medical bills or costs related to your treatment?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I have some bills. They\u2019re piling up, um, over a thousand dollars, I think. I\u2019m not sure how much exactly."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Every bit of documentation will help us understand your situation better. Have you already spoken to any other attorneys about this accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven\u2019t. You\u2019re the first people I\u2019m talking to about it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great, thank you for trusting us with your case. Just to clarify, are you aware of whether the other driver has insurance coverage for this type of incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I think they said they had insurance, but, um, I don\u2019t know the details."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s okay. We can look into that further if we proceed. Now, I want to recap what we\u2019ve discussed so far. You were in a car accident on June 21st in Boston, where another driver ran a red light and crashed into you. You sustained significant injuries, particularly to your neck and back, and you delayed medical treatment initially. You've started physical therapy and missed work, leading to some medical bills. You haven\u2019t spoken to any other attorneys yet, and you exchanged insurance information with the other driver, but you're not sure about the specifics."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, that sounds right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Alright! The next step will be for me to pass this information along to one of our attorneys. They'll review everything and get back to you. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Umm, just one\u2014how do the fees work?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great question! We work on a contingency fee basis, which means you won\u2019t owe us anything unless we win your case. If we do, our fees will come from the settlement or judgment amount."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Okay, that makes sense."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m glad to hear that! Thank you for sharing your story with me. I\u2019ll make sure to get this information to our attorney, and someone will reach out to you soon.

How can I assist you today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, hi. I, um, I need some help with, like, a product issue, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Of course! I\u2019m here to help. Can you tell me a little more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, so, um, I bought this blender, right? It was like, one of those fancy ones, and, um, it, like, exploded while I was using it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Oh wow, that sounds really dangerous! When did this happen?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "It was, uh, on April 24, 2022."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it, April 24, 2022. And where did this incident take place?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "In my apartment in, um, Miami, Florida."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thank you for that. So, you said the blender exploded? Can you describe what exactly happened? Were you injured?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, um, I was, like, pouring a smoothie into a glass, and then, like, it just... boom! It, like, exploded everywhere. I got cut by the glass, and, um, it was, like, really messy."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. How severe were your injuries? Did you need medical attention?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I had to go to the ER because, um, I had some cuts on my arm and, like, a bunch of glass in my hand. They had to, like, stitch me up."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really painful. I hope you\u2019re feeling better now. Did you happen to keep any records, like hospital bills or medical reports from that visit?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, yeah, I think I have the bills. They were, like, super expensive. I didn't expect it to be that much!"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "It can definitely add up quickly. Now, about the blender\u2014do you know the brand or model? And did you keep the receipt or any packaging?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, yeah, it was a brand called BlendMaster, I think? I, um, I might still have the receipt. I was, like, really upset, so I didn't check all the details."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Understandable! It\u2019s a lot to deal with after an incident like that. Have you had a chance to contact the manufacturer or retailer about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, no, I didn\u2019t. I was, like, too busy dealing with my injuries and everything."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That makes total sense. Have you discussed this with any other attorneys or received any legal advice about your case?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven\u2019t talked to anyone else. I just, um, didn\u2019t know what to do."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "You're in the right place to get some guidance. Now, about the blender, did you notice if there were any warnings or instructions that might have been missing? Or anything that seemed off before it exploded?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I mean, it had a manual, but, like, I didn\u2019t see anything unusual. I just thought it was, um, supposed to be safe, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Of course, it\u2019s reasonable to expect that a product like that would be safe to use. Did you happen to take any pictures of the blender after it exploded or of your injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I took a few pictures, like, right after it happened. They\u2019re on my phone, I think."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s great to hear! Having evidence like that can really help. Now, regarding insurance, did you exchange any information with the retailer or manufacturer about their insurance coverage?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, no, I didn\u2019t do that either. I just, like, didn\u2019t think about it at the time."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s alright; it\u2019s a lot to juggle when you\u2019re in pain and dealing with an incident like this. I\u2019m just trying to gather some details. Have you had any ongoing issues or complications from your injuries since the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, yeah, my hand still hurts sometimes, and, like, I can\u2019t grip things as well as I used to."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m really sorry to hear that. It\u2019s tough when injuries linger. Have you followed up with a doctor regarding those ongoing issues?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven\u2019t gone back yet. I, um, didn\u2019t think it was that serious."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "It\u2019s important to keep an eye on those things, especially if you\u2019re experiencing pain. So, just to summarize what we\u2019ve discussed: You had an incident with a BlendMaster blender on April 24, 2022, in Miami, where it exploded while you were using it, causing cuts that required ER treatment. You have medical bills and photos of the incident, but you haven\u2019t contacted the manufacturer or any attorneys yet. Is that about right?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, that\u2019s correct."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Perfect.

How can I assist you today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Hi, um, I\u2019m calling about a dog bite incident that happened recently."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I'm really sorry to hear that. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Sure! It was on September 1st in Denver. I was just walking in the park, you know, enjoying the day, and then this dog just ran up to me."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really unsettling. Was the dog on a leash?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, it wasn\u2019t. It just came running at me out of nowhere. I think it was a pit bull, but I\u2019m not totally sure."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I can imagine that was quite alarming. Did the dog bite you, or were you able to avoid it?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, it bit me on my leg. I tried to back away, but it was too fast."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Ouch! That sounds painful. Did you need any medical treatment for your injury?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I went to the ER afterward. They had to clean the wound and give me a tetanus shot. I have some bandages on it now."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m glad you got the medical care you needed. How would you describe your injuries? Are you experiencing a lot of pain or any complications?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Well, it hurts, but it\u2019s not, like, super bad. Just really sore, and I can\u2019t walk as well as I used to. I\u2019m worried it might get infected, though."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s definitely understandable. Infections can be a concern with dog bites. Do you know if the dog was up to date on its vaccinations?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I don\u2019t know. The owner wasn\u2019t around when it happened. I just saw the dog running around with no one in sight."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That's concerning. Did you happen to get any information about the dog or its owner? Like, did you see anyone who might have been with the dog?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I asked some people in the park, but no one really knew anything. I think the dog was just roaming free."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I see. That makes it a bit tricky, but not impossible. Did you manage to get any insurance information from the owner or see if they had a collar with tags?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I didn\u2019t see any tags, and I didn\u2019t get any insurance info. I was just kind of shocked at the moment, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Absolutely, I can imagine that would be quite a shock. It's common to feel overwhelmed in situations like that. Have you had a chance to speak with anyone else about your situation, like another attorney?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, you\u2019re the first ones I\u2019ve called."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, that\u2019s good to know. Just so you\u2019re aware, we work on a contingency fee basis, which means we only get paid if you win your case. Now, can you tell me if there were any witnesses to the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "There were a couple of other dog owners nearby, but I didn\u2019t catch their names or anything. I was just focused on my injury."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s understandable. Witnesses can really help to support your case, though, so if you remember any details later, it might be helpful. Now, how have your daily activities been affected since the bite?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Well, I\u2019ve had to take time off work because I can\u2019t walk properly. It\u2019s really frustrating. I\u2019m in sales, and I need to be out meeting clients."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I can see how that would impact not just your work life but your overall routine, too. Are you experiencing any other damages, like lost wages or extra medical expenses from this?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I\u2019ve missed a few days already, and the ER visit wasn\u2019t cheap either. I\u2019m worried about how long it\u2019s going to take to heal."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s really tough. It sounds like you're dealing with quite a bit. I\u2019ll make a note of the lost wages and medical expenses. Is there anything else you\u2019d like to share about your experience or any other questions you might have?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I guess I just want to know what the next steps are. Like, what happens now?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Absolutely! What we\u2019ll do is I\u2019ll gather all the information you\u2019ve provided today, and then I\u2019ll pass it along to one of our attorneys. They\u2019ll review your case and get back to you with the next steps. It usually takes a couple of days to hear back."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "That sounds good. Thanks for your help!"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "You\u2019re welcome! Just to summarize, you were bitten by a dog in a Denver park on September 1st, you received medical treatment, and you\u2019ve experienced pain and lost work due to the incident. You didn\u2019t get any insurance information or witness details, but we\u2019ll see how we can assist you with that. Is that all correct?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, that\u2019s right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! Thank you for sharing that with me. We\u2019ll be in touch soon.

I wanted to talk about an accident I had, um, with a product, I think it was like, a defect or something?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Of course! I\u2019m really sorry to hear that you had an accident. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, so, um, it was back in January of 2021. I was in Phoenix, and, um, I was using this, like, kitchen appliance, a blender, I think."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it\u2014so, you were using a blender. What exactly happened with the blender?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Well, it, um, just, like, exploded or something while I was using it. I was blending some, um, fruit for a smoothie, and then all of a sudden, bam! It just, like, burst open."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Oh wow, that sounds really scary! Were you injured at all when that happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, um, I got, like, some cuts from the glass, and there was, like, fruit and stuff everywhere. I... I think I have a scar on my hand now."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m sorry to hear that. It sounds like it was quite a mess. Did you seek any medical attention for those cuts?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I, um, I didn't go to the hospital or anything. I just, like, cleaned it up at home. It wasn\u2019t that serious, just, um, annoying, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I totally understand. Sometimes, injuries can feel worse than they are. Did you happen to keep the blender or any packaging that might show the brand or model?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I still have the blender. It\u2019s, um, a\u2014wait, let me see\u2014oh, it\u2019s a Bella blender. I think that\u2019s what it\u2019s called."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great, that\u2019s helpful information. Did you happen to take any pictures of the blender after it exploded? That could be useful."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I think I took a couple with my phone, but they\u2019re not, like, super clear."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s okay! Any pictures you have could still be useful. So, when you were using the blender, was there anything unusual about it before it exploded, like, any weird sounds or smells?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Not really... I mean, it was working fine, and then, like, out of nowhere, it just... blew up, I guess?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Understood. And did you purchase the blender from a store, or was it online?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I got it, um, online from Amazon."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thanks for sharing that. Now, did you check if the blender had any recalls or safety warnings after the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I didn\u2019t, um, think to do that. I just kind of, like, forgot about it after a while."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "No worries, that happens. I can help look into that if we move forward. Did you happen to contact the manufacturer or the seller about the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I... I didn\u2019t think it would, like, matter or anything."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, that\u2019s good to know. And did you exchange any insurance information with the manufacturer or seller?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I didn\u2019t even think about insurance. I just figured it was, um, my fault or something."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s understandable. It can be confusing. Just to clarify, you don\u2019t have any other attorney representing you in this matter, right?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, no one else is helping me with this."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Alright, that\u2019s good to know. So, just to recap: You had an incident with a Bella blender in January 2021 in Phoenix, where it exploded while you were using it. You sustained some cuts, but didn't seek medical attention. You still have the blender, and you didn't reach out to the manufacturer or check for recalls. Is there anything I missed or anything else you\u2019d like to add?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I think that\u2019s it. Just, um, I really just want to know if I can, like, do something about it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I understand. I\u2019ll pass this information along to one of our attorneys who will review it and get back to you. They can discuss your options in more detail."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Okay, that sounds good.

How can I assist you today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Hi, Carlos. Um, I\u2019m calling about an incident that happened a while ago, actually. It was in June of 2021."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I'm really sorry to hear that you\u2019ve had an incident. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, um, I was using this, like, kitchen appliance. It was a blender, and it, um, malfunctioned while I was using it. The blade, like, came loose and, um, it hurt my hand."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really painful! I can imagine that must have been quite a shock. Can you describe what exactly happened? Like, were you using it as intended when the malfunction occurred?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I was making a smoothie. I followed all the instructions, but, um, suddenly the blade just came off. I was, like, trying to pour it out, and it, um, sliced my hand pretty bad."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Ouch, that sounds really serious! Did you seek any medical treatment for your injury?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I didn\u2019t go right away\u2014like, I thought it wasn\u2019t that bad at first. But then, um, it got infected, and I had to go to the doctor about a week later."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I see. Delaying medical treatment can be tough. Were there any, like, medical expenses or treatments that you had to pay for after you went to the doctor?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, um, they put me on antibiotics, and I had to get a tetanus shot too. I think the total was, like, a couple hundred dollars."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thank you for sharing that. It\u2019s important to have those details. Now, do you remember the brand or model of the blender?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, yeah! It was a, uh, Ninja blender. I think it was one of their newer models, but I can\u2019t remember the exact name."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it, a Ninja blender. Did you happen to check if the company has any recalls or warnings related to that model?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I don\u2019t know... I just kind of assumed it was safe since I bought it new."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That makes sense. Sometimes, people don't realize there might be issues until something happens. Did you keep the receipt or any documentation about the blender?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I think I still have the receipt somewhere. I just don\u2019t know where right now."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "No worries, that can happen! It's good to know you have it. Did you happen to exchange any information with the store where you purchased it or with Ninja, like, about their warranty or anything?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I called their customer service after the incident. They didn\u2019t really help much, though. They just said to, like, send it back for inspection."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, that\u2019s helpful to know. So, you\u2019ve reached out to them already. Now, about the incident itself, were there any witnesses who saw what happened when the blender malfunctioned?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, um, I was home alone when it happened. So, um, no witnesses."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I see. That can be tough, but it sounds like you have a solid account of what occurred. Can I ask if your parents or guardians are aware of this situation? Since you mentioned that you\u2019re a minor, they'll likely need to be involved."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, they know. They\u2019re, um, kind of upset about it, but they didn\u2019t really know what to do either."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I understand. It can be overwhelming, especially with something like this. So, just to clarify, you don\u2019t have another attorney representing you in this matter right now, correct?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I don\u2019t. I was just, um, trying to figure out what my options are."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s completely understandable. We\u2019re here to help with that. Now, have you or your parents been able to contact Ninja\u2019s insurance or any liability coverage regarding the product?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t know if they have insurance for that stuff."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "No problem. It\u2019s not uncommon for people not to know the details. The important thing is that you reached out to us. Now, just to summarize what we discussed: you had an incident with a Ninja blender in June 2021, where the blade malfunctioned and injured your hand. You received medical treatment about a week after the injury, and you have some documentation related to the purchase. Your parents are involved, and you haven't spoken to another attorney yet."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, that\u2019s right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! I\u2019ll pass this information along to one of our attorneys who will review it and get back to you soon. They might have some further questions or suggestions on how to proceed. Is there anything else on your mind or any questions you have for me right now?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I think that\u2019s it. Thanks for, um, listening and for your help."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Absolutely! It\u2019s my pleasure to help. We\u2019ll be in touch soon, and I hope you feel better.

I'm sorry to hear that. Was your dog injured in the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, he was. He, um, had to go to the vet. The vet said he had, like, some pretty serious bite wounds. It was, um, really bad."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really tough. Did you get any information about the other dog or its owner?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes!

Did you happen to exchange insurance information with them?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I think, um, they gave me their insurance info. It was, um, something like, uh, I think it was Allstate or something?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful to know. Now, can you tell me more about your dog's injuries? What kind of treatment did they require?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, he had to get, like, stitches, and it was, uh, really expensive. I think the bill was over, um, like, a thousand dollars? Yeah, and he\u2019s, like, been really scared since then."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That must be really hard for you both. Is your dog, um, recovering okay now?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, he's doing better, but, like, he still gets really anxious around other dogs. I, um, worry that he might, like, be scared for a long time."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s understandable. It\u2019s really hard to see our pets go through something like that. Have you, um, missed any work or had any other expenses due to this incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I, um, had to take some time off to care for him, and, like, I had to pay for extra training to help him get over the fear. So, um, yeah, it\u2019s been a lot."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I see. It sounds like you\u2019ve had a lot to manage.

I, uh, heard some lawyers charge a lot upfront."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s a good question!

Dog bites can be pretty serious. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, so, it was, um, May 16th of last year, in Phoenix. I was just, like, walking in my neighborhood, you know? And this dog, it just, like, ran out of the yard and, um, bit me on the leg."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really painful. Was the dog on a leash at the time?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, it wasn\u2019t. The owner, um, was just kinda standing there, like, they didn\u2019t even try to call the dog back until after it bit me."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "So, it sounds like the owner might have some liability here since their dog wasn\u2019t restrained.

I didn\u2019t, um, get any insurance info or anything. I was, like, just shocked, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s completely understandable.

Have you seen a doctor or received any follow-up treatment since the emergency room visit?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I went to my regular doctor a few times after.

They\u2019re, um, in a folder somewhere at home."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Perfect, that\u2019ll be helpful if you decide to move forward. Just to confirm, there\u2019s no other significant expenses or injuries on your end, right?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Right, just the repair cost."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, great! I appreciate you sharing all this information. Here\u2019s what will happen next: I\u2019ll pass this information along to one of our attorneys who will review it and get back to you. They can provide options moving forward based on your situation."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "That sounds good. How long do you think that\u2019ll take?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Typically, we try to get back to clients within a few days. And, um, just to clarify, we work on a contingency fee basis, which means we only get paid if you win your case."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh, okay, that makes sense. Thanks for explaining that."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Of course! Do you have any other questions or concerns while I have you on the line?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, not really. I guess I just hope it all gets resolved quickly."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I totally get that. It can be a waiting game sometimes, but we\u2019ll make sure to keep you updated as we go along."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Alright, thank you so much, Diana."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "You\u2019re welcome! I appreciate you reaching out, and I hope you have a better day ahead. We\u2019ll be in touch soon!"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Thanks!

How can I assist you today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Hi Brenda, um, I\u2019m calling about a dog bite incident that happened a while ago."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m sorry to hear that you\u2019ve had to deal with that. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, so it was back on, um, October 21st, 2021. I was at a park in Colorado, and there was this dog that just, like, ran up to me and, um, bit me on the arm."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really painful. I hope you\u2019re doing okay now. Was the dog on a leash at the time?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, it wasn\u2019t. It just, like, came out of nowhere, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I can imagine that was quite a shock. Do you know if the dog had an owner present?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, the owner was there. They seemed kinda embarrassed and, um, said they would take care of it. I think they even gave me their insurance info, but I didn\u2019t really write it down."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s understandable. Do you remember the name of the insurance company at all?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I think it was\u2026 Oh! It was, like, Farmer's Insurance? Something like that."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! That helps a lot. Did you get the owner\u2019s name as well?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, it was, um, Jake. Jake something. But I can\u2019t remember the last name."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "No worries, that\u2019s okay. So, after the incident, did you seek any medical treatment for the bite?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, yeah. I went to the urgent care the same day. They just cleaned it up and gave me some antibiotics."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m glad you got treated. Did they mention any follow-up care or anything like that?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, not really. They just said to keep an eye on it. But, um, it was a bit sore for a while."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds uncomfortable. Have you had any other issues with that injury since then?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Well, I\u2019ve had some pain in my arm, but I mean, I\u2019ve had, like, issues with that arm before. So, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s related to the bite or just, you know, my old injuries."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I see. It can sometimes be hard to tell. Just to clarify, were you currently seeing a doctor for those previous injuries before the dog bite?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I was. I have some, like, old sports injuries. But I don\u2019t know if they, um, relate to this incident, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s totally understandable. It\u2019s important to differentiate between them. Do you have any pictures of the bite or any medical records from the urgent care visit?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I took a picture right after it happened, but I think I lost it. And I do have the records from the urgent care, though."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s great to hear. Those records can really help. Have you spoken to any other attorneys about this case?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, yeah, I talked to someone a while ago. They didn\u2019t seem very, um, helpful, though."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m sorry to hear that. It\u2019s important to find someone you feel comfortable with. Can I ask why you felt they weren\u2019t helpful?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I dunno. They just seemed, like, distracted or something. They didn\u2019t really listen to my story, I guess."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s frustrating. I completely understand. Just to confirm, are you still working with that attorney, or have you decided not to pursue it with them?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh, I\u2019ve decided not to go with them. I think I\u2019ll just try again with someone else."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That makes sense. I appreciate you sharing all this information with me. Just to recap, you were bitten by a dog in a park in Colorado on October 21, 2021, the owner was present and provided their insurance information, and you sought treatment at urgent care where you received antibiotics. You do have some previous injuries that might complicate things, but you\u2019re not currently working with another attorney."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, that sounds right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Perfect! I\u2019ll pass this information along to one of our attorneys who will review it and get back to you shortly. We work on a contingency fee basis, meaning you won\u2019t owe anything unless we win your case. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, no, I think that\u2019s it. Thanks for listening, Brenda."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "You\u2019re welcome! I\u2019m glad to be here for you. Keep an eye out for a call from our attorney soon.

How can I assist you today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Hi Diana, um, I had an accident at a friend's place a few days ago, and I'm not sure what to do next."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I'm really sorry to hear that. It sounds like a tough situation. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, so, um, it was on November 25th. I was at my friend\u2019s house in Colorado, and I slipped on some wet tiles in their kitchen. I fell and hit my back pretty hard."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds painful. I hope you're feeling okay. Were there any warning signs, like a \u201cWet Floor\u201d sign or anything like that?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, there wasn\u2019t any sign. I didn\u2019t even realize the floor was wet until I slipped. I think they had just mopped or something."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it, so there was no indication that the floor was slippery. Did your friend mention if they knew the floor was wet at the time?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I think they were in the living room and didn\u2019t see it happen. They said they didn\u2019t realize it was slippery."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, that\u2019s helpful to know. Have you been able to seek any medical attention for your back since the accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I went to the urgent care the next day. They did some X-rays and said it was just a bruise, but it hurts a lot, especially when I move around."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m glad you got checked out, but I can imagine how frustrating it must be dealing with that pain. Have you had to miss work because of it?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I\u2019ve missed a few days already. I work at a retail store, and it's been hard to lift things or stand for too long."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really challenging. So, just to clarify, you fell in your friend's kitchen, and you\u2019ve seen a doctor who diagnosed you with a bruise, but it\u2019s affecting your work as well. Is that right?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, exactly."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thank you for confirming that. Now, do you happen to know if your friend has any homeowner's or renter's insurance that might cover this type of incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I think they do have renter's insurance. I remember them mentioning it before, but I don\u2019t know the details or the insurance company."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s okay! It\u2019s a good start that you think they have coverage. Did you happen to exchange any insurance information with them after the accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, we didn\u2019t really talk about it after that. I was just focused on my back and, like, making sure I was okay."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That makes sense. It's tough to think about those things when you're in pain. Have you talked to your friend at all about this since the accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Not really. I texted them to let them know I was in pain, but we haven\u2019t had a full conversation about it since."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I understand. It can be a sensitive topic. Now, have you considered speaking to any other attorneys about this situation, or are we your first call?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, you\u2019re my first call. I really don\u2019t know much about this kind of stuff."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s completely fine. We\u2019re here to help you through this process. Since you mentioned that you slipped on a wet floor and have some injuries that are impacting your work, I\u2019ll make sure to pass all this information along to one of our attorneys. They\u2019ll review it and get back to you with the next steps."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Okay, that sounds good. I just want to make sure I\u2019m doing the right thing."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I totally understand that. It\u2019s important to feel comfortable with your next steps. Just to recap: you fell at your friend\u2019s house in Colorado on November 25th due to a slippery floor, you\u2019ve seen a doctor for your back, and you think your friend has renter's insurance, but you haven\u2019t discussed it with them yet. Is there anything else you think is important for us to know?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, no, I think that's it. I just really don\u2019t want to get my friend in trouble or anything."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s a valid concern, and we can certainly approach this situation with care. Our goal is to help you seek any compensation for your injuries while considering your friend\u2019s situation. I\u2019ll make sure to note that."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Thanks, I appreciate that."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Of course! Lastly, could I get your best contact number and email address so we can reach you once the attorney has reviewed your case?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Sure, my number is 555-123-4567, and my email is johndoe@example.com."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! Thank you, John. I\u2019ll pass along your information to our attorney, and they should be in touch soon.

I\u2019d be happy to help you with that. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, sure. It was, um, on October 29, 2020. I was, like, walking my dog in Seattle\u2014um, in this park near my neighborhood. I think it\u2019s called, um, Ravenna Park?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Ravenna Park, got it. So, you were walking your dog there. Can you describe what happened with the other dog?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, um, so I was just, like, minding my own business, and then this, um, big dog came up to us. I think it was a pit bull or something. And, um, it just, like, lunged at my dog and then, um, turned on me and bit my leg."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Oh no, that sounds really scary! I hope you\u2019re okay. Did you receive any medical treatment for your injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I went to the ER. They, um, gave me some stitches and, uh, prescribed some antibiotics. It was, like, pretty painful."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I can imagine. That must have been really tough. Were there any witnesses around who saw what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, yeah, there were a couple of people, like, nearby. They, um, came over to help after it happened. One of them even, like, took a picture of the dog and the owner."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s good to hear. Did you happen to get any information from the dog\u2019s owner? Like, did you exchange insurance information?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I didn\u2019t get a lot of info. The owner was, like, really upset and, um, left pretty quickly. But I think they said their name was, um, Mike? And, um, they mentioned their insurance company was, like, State Farm or something."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, so you have the dog owner's name and their insurance company. That\u2019s helpful. Did you file a report with animal control or the police after the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I did! I called animal control, and they, um, came out to take a report. They said they\u2019d investigate it. But I haven\u2019t heard anything back yet."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Alright. So you have an incident report that could be useful. Let\u2019s talk a bit more about your injuries. Besides the stitches, are there any long-term effects you\u2019re experiencing?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, my leg still hurts sometimes, and I have, like, these weird scars. It\u2019s just, like, really annoying. I\u2019ve been, uh, kind of scared to take my dog out since then."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really frustrating. It\u2019s understandable to feel that way after such an experience. Have you, um, missed any work because of your injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I missed about a week. I, um, work at a coffee shop, and they were, like, really understanding, but still, it was, um, tough."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I can see how that would be challenging. Have you had any other expenses related to the incident, like medical bills or other costs?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, yeah, the ER visit was, like, pretty expensive. I\u2019m still getting bills. And, um, I had to buy some new supplies for my dog to, like, help them feel safe."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Those costs can really add up. Just to clarify, have you spoken to any other attorneys about this case?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Nope, you\u2019re the first ones I\u2019m calling."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! I appreciate you reaching out to us. To summarize, you were bitten by a dog at Ravenna Park in Seattle on October 29, 2020.

How can I assist you today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Hi, Carlos. I\u2026 I want to talk about an accident I had a little while ago."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Of course! I\u2019m really sorry to hear you\u2019ve been in an accident. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, it was on January 10th of this year. I was at this local park in Colorado, and I tripped over a broken sidewalk section."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really frustrating. I can imagine that must have hurt. Was there anyone else around when it happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, there were a few people nearby. I think one person saw me fall, but I didn\u2019t really talk to them afterward."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I understand. So, was there any signage indicating that the sidewalk was broken? Or had there been any warnings about it?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, there wasn\u2019t any warning or anything. It was just kind of there, and I didn\u2019t see it until it was too late."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Alright. So, it sounds like the park might have some liability if they were aware of the issue and didn\u2019t fix it or warn people. Did you happen to report the incident to anyone at the park?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I told a park worker afterward, but I didn\u2019t fill out any official report. They just said they\u2019d look into it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it. And did you exchange any information with that worker, like a name or contact info?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I didn\u2019t get their name. I just thought they\u2019d take care of it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s understandable. Now, let\u2019s talk about your injuries. How did you feel after the fall? Did you seek any medical attention?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I went to the ER that same day. I ended up with a sprained ankle and some bruises. They gave me crutches and prescribed some pain meds."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m really sorry to hear that. A sprained ankle can be pretty painful. Have you had any ongoing issues since the incident, like follow-up appointments or therapy?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I had to go to physical therapy for a few weeks because I could barely walk. It\u2019s still a bit sore, to be honest."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I appreciate you sharing that with me. It sounds like this has really impacted your daily life. Now, did you happen to get any information about insurance coverage related to the park?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, not really. I didn\u2019t think about that at the time. I guess I didn\u2019t consider it could be a liability issue."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s okay! It\u2019s common to overlook those details in the moment. Do you happen to know if the park has any kind of liability insurance, or do you recall if they mentioned anything about that?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I don\u2019t remember them saying anything about insurance. I think they might be a city park, so I guess it could fall under the city\u2019s insurance?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s a possibility since many city parks are covered under municipal insurance. It might be worth looking into. Now, just to clarify, do you have any other attorneys representing you for this case?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I don\u2019t. I wanted to talk to someone first before deciding."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That makes sense. We\u2019re here to help you understand your options. So, just to recap before we move forward, you tripped on a broken sidewalk in a park in Colorado on January 10th, you sustained a sprained ankle and some bruising, you went to the ER and had physical therapy, but there was no official report made at the park. And you\u2019re not currently represented by another attorney."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, that\u2019s right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Perfect.

I\u2019d be happy to help you with that. Can you tell me a little more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Sure! It was on May 18, 2022, in Phoenix. I was at a grocery store, and there was a wet floor without any signs. I slipped and fell pretty hard."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really painful. I hope you\u2019re doing okay now. Was there anything else going on in the area, like cleaning or maybe a spill that wasn\u2019t cleaned up?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, yeah, I think there was a spill. The employees were, like, busy stocking shelves and didn\u2019t notice the floor was wet. There were no signs at all."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it. So, it sounds like the store may have been aware of the hazard but didn\u2019t take the right precautions. Did you happen to report the incident to the store management right after it happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I did. They came over and asked if I was okay, and I told them what happened. They took down my information, but I\u2019m not sure what they did after that."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s an important step. Did you manage to get any details about the store's insurance or did they mention anything about their coverage?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I didn\u2019t get any insurance info directly, but I think they have insurance because it\u2019s a pretty big chain. I, um, maybe should\u2019ve asked for more details."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s okay! It can be hard to think clearly in those situations.

Now, could you tell me about any injuries you sustained from the fall?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Well, I hurt my wrist and my back. It was pretty bad at first, and I had to go to the doctor. They said I had a sprain and some muscle strain."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m sorry to hear that. Getting medical attention is really important. Did you receive any follow-up care or treatment after your initial visit?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I had physical therapy for a couple of months. It helped, but I still have some pain now and then."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That must be frustrating. Have you kept any records of your medical bills or treatments?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I\u2019ve got all the bills. It\u2019s, um, a lot, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s, like, super serious, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I understand. Every bit helps when it comes to putting your case together. Now, I noticed you mentioned you had previous representation. Can you tell me more about that?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Right. I spoke to another lawyer right after the accident, but I didn\u2019t feel like they were really helping me. They didn\u2019t seem interested, so I didn\u2019t go forward with them."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That can be really discouraging. It\u2019s important to feel supported. Do you know if they filed any paperwork or took any steps on your behalf?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, nothing was filed. I just talked to them a couple of times, and then I decided to look for someone else."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, that makes sense. So, what made you reach out to us today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Well, I\u2019ve been thinking about it for a while, and I heard good things about your firm. I just want to make sure I\u2019m doing the right thing moving forward."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "We appreciate your trust! I can assure you, we\u2019re here to help you navigate this. Just to clarify, do you have any other representation currently, or are you ready to explore your options with us?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I think I\u2019m ready to move on. I just don\u2019t want to feel like I\u2019m being ignored again."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I completely understand. It\u2019s crucial to have someone who\u2019s attentive to your needs. I\u2019ll make a note that you\u2019re not currently represented."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Thanks, that helps."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Of course! Just to recap what we\u2019ve discussed: you had a slip-and-fall accident at a grocery store in Phoenix on May 18, 2022, due to a wet floor without warning signs. You reported it to the store, and you have some medical bills and treatment records for your wrist and back injuries. You previously spoke to another attorney but felt they weren\u2019t helping you."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, that sounds right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! The next steps are that I\u2019ll pass this information along to one of our attorneys. They will review everything and get back to you about how we can assist you moving forward."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "That sounds good."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Perfect! Is there anything else you\u2019d like to ask me while we\u2019re on the phone?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, no, I think that\u2019s it for now. Just hoping to hear back soon."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Absolutely, we aim to follow up quickly. Thank you for sharing your experience with me today, and take care! We\u2019ll be in touch soon."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Thank you, Diana."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "You\u2019re welcome! Have a great day!"}], "outcome_status": "settled", "outcome_value": 30000}

How can I help you today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, hi. I, uh, I think I need some help with, like, a dog bite case?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I'm really sorry to hear that. I can definitely help you with that. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Right, um, it was, like, on July 27th, 2020. I was walking in the park, and this dog just, like, ran up to me. It wasn't on a leash or anything, and then it, um, bit my leg."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really painful. I\u2019m sorry you went through that. Was the dog, like, owned by someone nearby, or was it just a stray?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, um, it had an owner. I think they were, like, sitting on a bench or something. The dog, uh, ran over to me without them, I guess."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Did you get a chance to talk to the owner after the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I did. They, um, they seemed a bit nervous, but they said they would, like, take care of the vet bills or whatever. I didn\u2019t get their insurance info, though."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I see. Did you manage to get the name of the dog owner or any contact information?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, I think their name was, um, like, Sarah? I\u2019m not sure about the last name, though. But I have their phone number."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s helpful. Have you, um, received any medical treatment for your injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I went to the hospital, and they, like, cleaned the bite and gave me some antibiotics. I have, um, a scar now, and it still hurts sometimes."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I'm really sorry to hear that. Scars can be tough, especially when they affect your daily life. Have you documented those medical visits or, like, any ongoing pain?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I have all the, um, paperwork from the hospital. They gave me a bunch of stuff to take home."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great, having that documentation will be important. Um, can I ask if you have any pictures of the injury or the area where it happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I took some pictures, like, right after it happened. I think I still have them on my phone."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s good to know. So, just to clarify, do you have any other representation for this case or, like, have you spoken to another attorney?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven\u2019t talked to anyone else about it. I, um, wasn\u2019t sure what to do."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Totally understandable. I'm glad you reached out. So, you mentioned the owner said they would cover vet bills. Did they give you any information about their insurance or, like, if they had homeowner's coverage?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, no, they didn\u2019t mention anything about insurance. I just, um, assumed they had something since they said they\u2019d help."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it. It\u2019s common for owners to have some sort of coverage, but we\u2019ll need to follow up on that. And, um, how do you feel about the owner's liability in this situation? Do you think they were responsible for not having the dog leashed?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I mean, I think they should\u2019ve had it on a leash. It was, like, a public park, you know? So, um, I feel like they should be accountable."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That makes sense. Liability can sometimes be tricky, but it sounds like there\u2019s a case for it. Now, I want to ask about your damages. Besides the medical expenses, have you experienced, like, any emotional distress or had to miss work?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I didn't miss work, but I'm, like, really anxious about dogs now. Like, I don't like going to the park anymore, which is, um, kinda hard since I used to go all the time."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s understandable, and it can have a real impact on your quality of life. So, just to summarize what we\u2019ve talked about: You were bitten by a dog in a park in Seattle on July 27, 2020. You received medical treatment, have documentation, and took pictures of the injury. The dog owner seemed willing to help but didn't provide insurance information. You feel the owner was responsible for the dog's behavior, and you have some emotional distress from the incident."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, that sounds right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! I\u2019ll pass this information along to one of our attorneys who will review it and get back to you.

Can you tell me a bit more about what happened during the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Sure, um, it was on July 11th, 2020, and I was, like, walking in my neighborhood in Atlanta, right?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, in Atlanta. And were you on the sidewalk or in the street when this happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I was on the sidewalk, um, just walking my dog. And then, this, like, big dog came running out of a yard and, um, attacked me and my dog."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Oh no, that sounds really frightening. Was the dog on a leash, or did it just, um, come out on its own?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, it wasn\u2019t on a leash. It just, um, ran out. I think the gate was left open or something."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it. So, the dog was not contained. Did you see the owner at all?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, the owner came running after the dog, like, right after it started to, um, attack us. He was yelling for it to stop."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I see. And were you or your dog injured in the attack?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I, um, I got bit on my arm and had to go to the hospital. My dog, uh, was scared but didn\u2019t get hurt."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m really sorry to hear that you were hurt. How bad were your injuries? Did you need any, um, surgery or anything like that?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I, um, had to get stitches. They said it was pretty deep, and I had to go back a few times for, like, follow-up appointments."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really painful. Did you take any time off work because of your injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I had to take about three weeks off, and um, I\u2019m still dealing with some pain in my arm."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s definitely understandable. It sounds like it\u2019s been quite a journey for you. Now, did you get any information from the dog owner, like, did they have insurance?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, yeah, I got their name and number, and they said they had insurance, but I, um, I didn\u2019t get the policy details or anything like that."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s okay! It\u2019s good that you at least got their contact info. Do you remember the name of their insurance company?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I think it was, like, State Farm or something? I\u2019m not 100% sure."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s alright. So, just to clarify, you haven\u2019t spoken to an attorney about this before, right?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven't. This is the first time I\u2019m, um, looking into it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it. That\u2019s helpful to know.

I\u2019ve been keeping track of everything."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s great! Keeping those records will be really helpful. So just to summarize: You were bitten by a dog on July 11, 2020, while walking in Atlanta, and you had to get stitches and take time off work.

Can you tell me a bit more about the accident? When did it happen?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, it was, um, on May 5th... or maybe it was the 6th? No, no, it was definitely the 5th, I think."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it! So, May 5th, 2025. And where did this accident happen?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "It was in Miami, FL, um, at this store... you know, like a grocery store or something."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, a grocery store in Miami. What exactly happened there?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Well, I was, um, walking down an aisle, and I, like, slipped on, uh, some spilled juice or, um, something sticky on the floor. It was really slippery, like, I didn\u2019t see it at all."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really uncomfortable. I hope you\u2019re okay! Were there any warning signs or, um, anything to indicate the floor was wet?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, not really. I mean, there might've been, like, a wet floor sign, but I didn\u2019t see it. It was just... boom, I fell."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I understand. So, you fell due to the slippery floor. Did you notice if there were any employees nearby when it happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, there was, um, a lady stocking shelves. She, like, looked at me but didn\u2019t come over until I was already on the ground."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s frustrating. Did you end up talking to her or any other employees after you fell?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, I think I talked to her a little after. She, um, asked if I was okay, I guess. But, like, I was kinda embarrassed, so I just said I was fine even though I wasn\u2019t really."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I can understand that. It can be tough in those situations. Did you, um, seek any medical attention after the fall?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, not right away, no. I thought I\u2019d be fine, but then later, um, my back started hurting, like, a lot. So, I went to, uh, my doctor a couple of days later."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, so you saw your doctor a few days after the accident. What did they say about your injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "They said I had, um, a strain or something. I got some, like, pain meds and stuff, but it\u2019s still, like, hurting sometimes."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m sorry to hear that. It's important to take care of yourself. Have you, um, kept any records of your medical visits or expenses related to this?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I think so? Like, I have some receipts and, um, maybe my doctor\u2019s notes? But I, like, don\u2019t remember where I put them..."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s okay, it's a lot to keep track of. So, besides the medical issues, did you experience any other damages from the fall, like lost wages or anything?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, not really. I didn\u2019t miss work, but, like, I couldn\u2019t do some stuff at home, you know? Like, I couldn\u2019t lift stuff for a while."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I see. So, it sounds like it affected your daily activities. Did you happen to exchange insurance information with the grocery store, or do you know if they have liability insurance?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh! Yeah, they, um, gave me their insurance info. It was, uh, something like... I think it was SafeGuard Insurance? I\u2019m not sure, but it was something like that."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "SafeGuard Insurance, okay. That\u2019s good to have. Did the store or their insurance adjuster, um, reach out to you after the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, no, not really. I thought they would, but, like, no one called me. I just, like, thought I should do something about it myself."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Gotcha. So, you haven\u2019t had any follow-up from them yet. Just to clarify, have you spoken to any other attorneys about this incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, not really. I just, um, thought I\u2019d call you guys first."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! I appreciate you considering us. Just to recap, you slipped and fell in a grocery store in Miami on May 5th, 2025, because of a slippery floor. You saw a doctor a few days later for back pain and got some medication.

You exchanged insurance info with the store, and they haven\u2019t contacted you since."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, that sounds about right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Perfect.

Nothing too serious, thankfully."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s a relief to hear. Were there any medical treatments that he received for those injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, he went to the doctor the day after the accident. They just checked him out, and he had some physical therapy sessions for the whiplash."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I see. How is he feeling now? Is he back to his normal activities?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Mostly. He still gets some, like, neck pain sometimes, but it\u2019s not as bad as it was. He\u2019s mostly back to normal."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s good to hear. I want to ask about the other driver. Did you exchange insurance information at the scene?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, we did. Their insurance is with State Farm."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! It sounds like you have that covered. Do you know if the other driver was cited for running the red light?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, they did get a ticket. I think it was for running a red light or something like that."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That definitely helps establish liability. So, was your son driving his own car, or was it a family vehicle?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "It was our family car, a Honda Civic."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, good to know. Now, has your son received any compensation from the other driver's insurance yet?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, not yet. We, like, haven\u2019t started that process. I wasn\u2019t sure how to go about it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s understandable. We can definitely assist with that. Since your son is a minor, you'll be the one handling the case, correct?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, that\u2019s right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Perfect.

I was, um, taking a walk in my neighborhood in Arizona when a dog came out of nowhere and, like, bit me on the leg."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really painful. I hope you're doing okay now. Was this dog, um, on a leash or in a yard, or...?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, it was just running loose. I think it was a pit bull, and it, like, charged at me. I didn\u2019t see the owner around at all."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it. So it sounds like the dog was not being contained at the time. Did you happen to get the owner\u2019s information or any insurance details?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I didn\u2019t get the owner\u2019s info. I was kinda in shock, you know? But I did see the dog was wearing a collar, and I think there was a tag on it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s understandable. It's a lot to take in during an incident like that. Did you happen to get the name of the tag or any details about it, or maybe the name of the owner?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I think the tag said \u201cMax,\u201d but I can\u2019t remember the last name or anything."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, that\u2019s still a helpful lead. Did you notice if the owner was nearby at all?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, not at all. I looked around after it happened, but there was no one in sight."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I see. And, um, did you seek any medical attention after the bite?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I went to the hospital.

Do you recall how severe the injury was? Like, were there any stitches or anything like that?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, they had to stitch it up. It was pretty deep."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Oh no, that sounds really serious. How are you feeling now? Have you experienced any ongoing pain or complications?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Well, it still hurts a bit, especially when I walk.

I\u2019m trying to catch up, but it\u2019s hard with the pain."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I can imagine that\u2019s tough. And, um, did you exchange any information about insurance with the owner, or do you know if they have homeowner\u2019s insurance or something similar?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I didn\u2019t get any of that. I think they might have been renting, but I\u2019m not sure."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, that\u2019s helpful to know. So it sounds like you might need to investigate that further if you decide to pursue this. I also noticed that you mentioned you\u2019re working with another attorney already. Can I ask what led you to reach out to us as well?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I spoke to someone, but I\u2019m not sure they\u2019re as, um, invested as I\u2019d like. Plus, I just want to explore my options."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s totally understandable. It\u2019s important to feel comfortable with who you\u2019re working with. Just to clarify, what are you hoping to achieve by reaching out to us today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I just want to know if I have a case and what my options are."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Absolutely. That makes sense. Just to summarize, you were bitten by a loose dog named Max on November 3rd, and you received medical treatment that involved stitches. You\u2019ve experienced ongoing pain, and you\u2019re currently missing work due to the injury. You didn\u2019t get the owner\u2019s information, but you think they might be renting. And you\u2019ve been in contact with another attorney but are looking for more options."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, that\u2019s right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thank you for confirming that. I\u2019ll pass this information along to one of our attorneys, who will review it and get back to you. They\u2019ll be able to discuss your options and the next steps. Also, I want to mention that we work on a contingency fee basis, meaning you wouldn\u2019t have to pay unless we secure a recovery for you."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Okay, that sounds good."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! Is there anything else you\u2019d like to ask or discuss before we wrap up?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I think that covers it. Thanks for your help."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Of course! Thank you for sharing your experience with me. We\u2019ll be in touch soon. Take care!"}], "outcome_status": "settled", "outcome_value": 75000}

I was in an accident, um, a few months ago, and I\u2019m trying to figure out what to do next."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m really sorry to hear that. It must be a tough situation. Can you tell me a bit more about the accident? Like when and where it happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, it was, um, April 22nd, in Austin, Texas."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thank you for that detail! Can you walk me through what happened during the accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Sure, um, I was driving, and I had a green light, but this other car just, like, ran the red light and crashed into me. I didn\u2019t see it coming at all."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really alarming. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re okay. So, it sounds like there\u2019s a clear fault on the other driver\u2019s part. Did you happen to get their insurance information at the scene?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uhh, I think so. They had, um, a State Farm policy, I believe."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great, that\u2019s helpful. So, just to confirm, you exchanged insurance details with them, right?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, yeah, I did. I got, um, their name and the insurance info."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Perfect! Now, let\u2019s talk about your injuries. Can you share what kind of injuries you sustained from the accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh man, it was pretty bad. I, uh, had a concussion and some neck pain. I\u2019ve been going to physical therapy for a while now. It's, like, really affecting my daily life."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m really sorry to hear that you\u2019ve been dealing with those injuries. How have they affected your day-to-day activities?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Well, um, I\u2019ve had trouble working. I, um, missed a lot of days because of the pain and therapy. It\u2019s just been really frustrating."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really challenging. Have you been able to keep records of your medical treatments and any missed work?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I, uh, have all my medical bills and, like, a note from my doctor about the therapy and everything."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s excellent to hear. Those documents will be important for your case. Just to clarify, have you spoken to or hired another attorney regarding this accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven\u2019t. This is my first time reaching out for help."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, that\u2019s good to know. Now, you mentioned earlier about the other driver running a red light. Were there any witnesses who saw the accident occur?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, there were a couple of people who stopped to help and, um, they said they saw everything. I think one of them gave their info to the cops."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s really helpful! Witnesses can often make a big difference in establishing liability. Were the police called to the scene?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, the cops came, um, and they filed a report. I think the other driver got a ticket for running the red light too."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That is really important information. It sounds like there\u2019s strong evidence of liability. Just to touch on insurance a bit more, what about your own insurance? Do you have uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I think I do, but I\u2019m not sure how that works. I just pay my premiums and don\u2019t really look at the details."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "No problem! That\u2019s something we can help clarify later. I\u2019ll make a note that you may have that coverage. Now, regarding the physical and emotional impact of the accident, have you experienced any other challenges, like anxiety or stress?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I\u2019ve been, um, really anxious since the accident. I have trouble sleeping and, like, just driving again. It\u2019s been tough on me."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I can only imagine how difficult that must be. It\u2019s completely understandable to feel that way after such a traumatic experience. Thank you for being open about it."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, yeah. I just want to figure out what to do next."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Absolutely! Here\u2019s what we can do. I\u2019ll pass along all this information to one of our attorneys who will review your case. They\u2019ll get back to you, typically within a couple of days."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Okay, that sounds good."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Also, just to clarify a bit about the process, we work on a contingency fee basis, which means you won\u2019t owe us anything unless we secure a settlement or a judgment for you. Does that make sense?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, that makes sense."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! So, to recap, you were in an accident on April 22nd in Austin, Texas, where the other driver ran a red light and hit you. You sustained significant injuries, including a concussion and neck pain, and you\u2019ve been attending physical therapy. You\u2019ve gathered some medical records and insurance information from the other driver, and you haven\u2019t spoken to another attorney yet."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Right, that\u2019s all correct."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Awesome! Thank you for sharing all this information with me. I know it\u2019s not easy. I\u2019ll make sure to pass this along to our attorney, and they\u2019ll be in touch with you soon.

I\u2019m here to help you through this process. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Sure. So, it was, um, February 1st of last year, I think. I was driving through Atlanta, and I got hit by another car."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, so February 1st, 2022, in Atlanta. Can you describe how the accident occurred? Were you at a stoplight, or were you, like, merging into traffic?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I was, um, just driving straight, and this car ran a red light and hit me. It was, like, a crazy situation."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Wow, that sounds really scary, Kevin. Did you happen to exchange insurance information with the other driver?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I think so. Um, they gave me their insurance info, but I don\u2019t remember the company name. It was, like, an old-school name or something."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s okay! It happens. It\u2019s good that you exchanged information. Do you remember if they mentioned anything about their coverage or if they seemed to have insurance?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I, um, think they said they had insurance, but I didn\u2019t ask for details or anything. I was just kind of shocked after the crash."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Totally understandable! It\u2019s a lot to process in that moment. Did the police come to the scene? Were there any reports made?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, the police came. They, like, made a report, but I didn\u2019t get a copy of it. I was, um, just focused on making sure I was okay."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That makes sense. Your health is the top priority! Speaking of which, how did you feel right after the accident? Did you notice any injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh yeah, I was definitely hurt. My neck and back were, like, killing me. I ended up going to the hospital later that night. They said I had a concussion and some neck strain."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m really sorry to hear that, Kevin. It sounds like you went through a lot. Have you been receiving any treatment since then, like physical therapy or follow-ups?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I\u2019ve been going to physical therapy for my back and neck. It's been, um, a few months now. The pain is still there, but I\u2019m trying to work through it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s good to hear that you\u2019re being proactive about your recovery. In terms of your medical expenses, have you been keeping track of those?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I\u2019ve got bills piling up. It\u2019s pretty overwhelming. I didn\u2019t expect all this, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I can only imagine. Medical bills can add up quickly. Have you discussed any of this with another attorney, or are you currently working with someone?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven\u2019t talked to anyone else yet. I was just, like, trying to figure out what to do first."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s perfectly fine! You\u2019re taking the right step by reaching out now. Can I ask if you\u2019ve had any conversations with the other driver\u2019s insurance company yet?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, no. I haven\u2019t talked to them. I didn\u2019t want to deal with it myself."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s completely understandable, Kevin. Sometimes, it can feel like too much to handle. I\u2019m here to help you through this process. Just to clarify, do you feel there's any fault on your part in the accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I don\u2019t think so. The other driver ran the red light, so it\u2019s not my fault. But, um, I guess I didn\u2019t have a dashcam, so I don\u2019t have video proof or anything."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I understand. It\u2019s tough when you don\u2019t have all the evidence. But it sounds like there were witnesses or police involved, which can help. Moving forward, you\u2019ll want to make sure all your medical records and bills are documented, as it sounds like your injuries are pretty significant."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, definitely. I\u2019ve got all my medical receipts and stuff organized."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s great! Keeping everything organized will make this process smoother. Just to reiterate, it sounds like you were rear-ended by another driver who ran a red light, you\u2019ve been receiving treatment for a concussion and neck strain, and you have medical bills piling up. Is that accurate?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, that sounds right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Awesome! I\u2019ll pass this information along to one of our attorneys who will review it and get back to you about the next steps. Do you have any additional questions or concerns before we wrap up?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I guess I just want to know how the fees work. I\u2019m kind of worried about costs."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s a valid concern, Kevin. We work on a contingency fee basis, which means you won\u2019t owe us anything upfront. We only get paid if you win your case. So, you won\u2019t have to worry about paying out of pocket while we work on it."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh, okay. That\u2019s a relief!"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m glad to hear that! We want to make this as easy as possible for you. If you think of anything else or have more questions later, feel free to call us back."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Thanks, Brenda.

How can I assist you today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, hi, Carlos. I\u2019m calling about a dog bite incident I had a few months ago."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m sorry to hear that you experienced a dog bite. That sounds really tough. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Sure. It was, um, on March 24th, I think. I was walking in this park in Seattle, and, um, I guess a dog just ran up to me and bit my leg."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really painful! Was the dog on a leash at the time?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, it wasn\u2019t. I mean, I don\u2019t think it was. It all happened pretty fast, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I can imagine. Did you see the owner of the dog at all?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, there was an owner, um, they were kind of far away. I think they called the dog back right after it happened."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, so the owner was there. Did you get their contact information or any insurance details?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I think I got their name, but I\u2019m not sure about the insurance. I might have asked, but it was all a blur."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s understandable. Sometimes these things can be overwhelming. Do you remember the owner\u2019s name or the type of dog?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I think the dog was a golden retriever. And the owner\u2019s name was... um, it was something like... Mark? Yeah, Mark."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great, that helps. And how about your injuries? Can you describe what you\u2019ve been dealing with since the bite?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Well, it hurt a lot at first. I had a couple of puncture wounds on my leg, and, um, I think I might have gotten an infection. I went to the doctor, and they gave me some antibiotics."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m sorry to hear that. It sounds really painful. Have you had any ongoing issues since the bite, or was it just a one-time thing?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I think I\u2019m mostly okay now. I mean, the wounds healed, but I still get a bit of pain, like, if I walk too much."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds frustrating. Have you had any medical bills related to this incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I went to the doctor, and there were a few bills. But honestly, it wasn\u2019t, like, super expensive or anything. I think it was just a couple of hundred dollars."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, that\u2019s good to know. And just to clarify, you don\u2019t currently have another attorney representing you in this case, right?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I don\u2019t have anyone else. I just thought I\u2019d reach out and see what my options are."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Absolutely, and I appreciate you calling us! So, let\u2019s talk a bit about the liability. Do you think the owner of the dog was responsible for the bite?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, well, I mean, I guess they should\u2019ve had the dog on a leash? But, like, I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019re really liable or anything."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s a fair point. Sometimes it can be tricky to determine liability in these situations. Did the owner say anything to you after the bite?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I think they apologized, but I don\u2019t really remember what else they said."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, that\u2019s understandable. So, you mentioned medical bills, but are there any other damages or losses you\u2019ve experienced because of the bite, like lost wages or emotional distress?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I didn\u2019t miss any work, but I\u2019ve been kind of anxious about dogs since then. Like, I used to love them, but now... I don\u2019t know."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That makes a lot of sense. It\u2019s completely normal to feel that way after such an experience. I want to make sure I have all the details down. To recap: You were bitten by a dog in a park in Seattle on March 24th, the dog was not on a leash, and the owner, named Mark, was nearby but you weren\u2019t able to get insurance information. You received some medical treatment, and while you have some ongoing discomfort, there weren\u2019t significant medical expenses. Is that correct?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, that sounds about right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! Thank you for clarifying that.

Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, so it was like, May 21st, I think? And I was driving, um, in Miami, and this other car just, like, ran a red light and hit me."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Oh wow, that sounds really scary. So, just to clarify, you were the one driving, and the other driver ran a red light, correct?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, exactly! I was, um, just sitting there at the light, and then bam! They just came out of nowhere."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really frustrating. Were there any witnesses to the accident, or did you happen to get the other driver's information?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I think there were a couple of people who saw it, but I didn\u2019t get their names. I did get the other driver\u2019s insurance info, though. I think it was, um, State Farm or something like that."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great that you got that information! Did you have a chance to exchange insurance details with the other driver, like their policy number or anything?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, yeah, I think so. But I\u2019m not really sure about the policy number. They were kinda in a hurry to leave, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I understand. It can be hectic after an accident. You mentioned you were driving\u2014were there any other passengers in your car at the time?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, my friend was with me. Um, they were kinda shaken up too, but I think I was the one who got hurt the most."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me about your injuries? What kind of treatment did you have to get?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Ugh, it was pretty bad. I had to go to the hospital. They said I had a concussion and some, like, whiplash. And my back really hurt too."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really painful. Did you have to follow up with any specialists afterwards, like a chiropractor or a physical therapist?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I went to a chiropractor for a few months, and I still have some, like, back pain sometimes. I didn\u2019t really get any physical therapy, though. Just the chiropractor."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I see. So you were treated for your injuries at the hospital and then continued with chiropractic care. Have you incurred any medical bills from all this?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh, for sure. I mean, it was a lot. I don\u2019t have the exact amount, but the hospital bill was, like, super high and then the chiropractor fees added up too."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I can imagine. It sounds like you\u2019ve been through a lot. Have you missed any work or school because of your injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I missed a few weeks of school, and I had to, like, catch up on everything. I think it was around three weeks or something."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s quite a bit of time. I hope you were able to get the support you needed with your studies. Just to confirm, were you driving alone when the accident happened, or was anyone else in your vehicle?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Right, I had my friend with me. I totally forgot to mention that."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "No worries! Thank you for clarifying. Now, have you talked to any other attorneys about this accident, or are you looking to work with us exclusively?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven\u2019t talked to anyone else. Just you guys. I saw your ads and thought it would be good to call."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thank you for choosing us! We appreciate your trust. I just want to clarify a few more things. Since you mentioned you were hurt pretty badly, do you know if the other driver\u2019s insurance company is already aware of the accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, I\u2019m not sure. I didn\u2019t really follow up with them after the accident. I was just focusing on getting better."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That makes sense. You were dealing with a lot. I\u2019ll make sure to note that down. Now, regarding the insurance coverage, have you had any communication with State Farm about your injuries or your medical bills?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I think I called them once, but they didn\u2019t really give me much info. They said I should talk to an attorney to get everything sorted out."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s a smart move. It can be complicated dealing with insurance companies.

You suffered significant injuries, including a concussion and whiplash, and received treatment from a hospital and a chiropractor.

How can I help you today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, hi. I\u2019m, um, I\u2019m calling about a, um, car accident I was in, like, a few weeks ago."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m sorry to hear that. I hope you\u2019re okay. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, it was, um, on August 16th. I was driving in Arizona, um, and I got hit by another car."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it. So, you were driving and another car struck you. Can you describe how the accident happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I was, like, just stopping at a red light when this other car, um, just ran right into me from behind. I didn\u2019t see it coming at all."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really stressful. Did you happen to notice if the other driver was doing anything unusual, like speeding or using their phone?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, yeah, now that you mention it, I think they were, um, swerving a little before they hit me. And I, like, could smell alcohol when they got out of the car."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Oh wow, that\u2019s concerning. Did the police come to the scene of the accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, they did. They, um, took a report and everything. I think they also, like, did a breathalyzer test on the other driver."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s good to hear that the police were involved. Did you get a copy of the police report, or do you know how to obtain one?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I, um, I didn\u2019t get it yet. I was just, like, really shaken up after the accident. But I think I can, um, request it from the police station."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That makes sense. It\u2019s understandable to feel overwhelmed in that situation. Now, did you exchange insurance information with the other driver?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, yeah, I did. Their insurance is, um, I think it\u2019s called, like, State, um, State Farm or something?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, State Farm. That\u2019s helpful. Did you happen to get their policy number or any other details about their insurance?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I, um, I didn\u2019t get the policy number. I was just focused on, like, my car and everything."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s understandable. So, about your car\u2014how\u2019s the damage? Was it pretty extensive?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, well, there\u2019s, like, a small dent, but it\u2019s, um, not too bad. I think it\u2019s, like, driveable still, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Gotcha. It sounds like the damage isn\u2019t too severe, which is good to hear. Now, how about your injuries? Did you have any, um, medical treatment after the accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, yeah, I went to the hospital, um, later that night. I had, like, some back pain and my neck was hurting a bit. They said it was probably whiplash."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m sorry to hear that. Whiplash can be really uncomfortable. Did they give you any medications or treatments for your pain?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, they gave me, um, like, some painkillers and told me to do physical therapy. I haven\u2019t started that yet, though."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, so you\u2019re still in the early stages of recovery. Have you seen any other doctors or specialists since the accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, no, not yet. I\u2019ve just been, like, trying to rest and see if it gets better on its own."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That makes sense. It\u2019s important to take care of yourself. Now, just to clarify, do you already have an attorney representing you for this accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I don\u2019t. I was, um, thinking I might need one, though, since it was, like, a pretty serious accident."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Absolutely, it\u2019s a good idea to consider legal representation, especially with the circumstances you\u2019ve described. Just to recap everything we\u2019ve talked about: the accident happened on August 16th in Arizona, you were hit from behind while stopped at a red light, and the other driver may have been under the influence of alcohol. You\u2019ve exchanged insurance info with State Farm, but you don\u2019t have the policy number yet. Your car has minimal damage, and you went to the hospital for neck and back pain, which they suspect is whiplash."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, that sounds about right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great. I\u2019ll pass this information along to one of our attorneys who will review it and get back to you. Our consultations are free, and if we take your case, we\u2019ll work on a contingency fee basis, meaning you won\u2019t owe us anything unless we win for you."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "That sounds good. Thanks for your help, Alex."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "You\u2019re welcome! I\u2019m glad I could help. You should hear back from us soon. Take care, and I hope you feel better!"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Thanks, you too!

How can I assist you today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Hi, um, I\u2019m calling about an injury I had from a product."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m sorry to hear that. I\u2019d be happy to help. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Sure, it was on November 9th last year. I bought this kitchen appliance, a blender, from a store in Boston, and it, like, exploded while I was using it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Oh no, that sounds really dangerous! I can imagine that was quite a shock. Can you describe what exactly happened when it exploded?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, so I was blending some ingredients for a smoothie, and suddenly, the top just blew off. There was, like, glass and stuff everywhere. I got cut on my hand, and, um, I think I might have had some bruises from the glass flying around."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really scary. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re okay, but I\u2019m sorry you had to go through that. Did you receive any medical treatment for your injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I did go to the ER because my hand was bleeding pretty badly. They, um, cleaned it up and gave me some stitches. I still have a scar, which is, like, really annoying."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I can understand how frustrating that must be. Scars can really impact your confidence. Have you had any follow-up visits or ongoing treatment for your hand?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, just that one time. I mean, it\u2019s healing, but I\u2019m just worried it\u2019s gonna look weird forever."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s completely valid. It\u2019s tough to deal with those kinds of concerns. Now, regarding the blender, do you know the brand or model?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, it was a brand called KitchenPro. I think it was their latest model or something."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it. And did you happen to keep the receipt or any packaging that might have information on the warranty or safety instructions?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I think I threw the box away, but I still have the receipt somewhere."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s helpful. Sometimes that information can be crucial. Did you report the incident to the store where you bought it or to the manufacturer?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I did tell the store, and they just said I could return it for a refund but didn't really seem to care about the injury. I didn\u2019t contact the manufacturer, though."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I see. It can be frustrating when they don\u2019t take it seriously. Did you happen to exchange any information with the store, like their insurance details or anything like that?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I didn\u2019t get any insurance info from them. I didn\u2019t think about that at the time."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s understandable. It can be overwhelming in the moment. Now, in terms of your injuries, have you missed any work or incurred any other expenses due to this incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I missed a couple of days from work because it was, um, hard to use my hand properly. And I had to buy, like, bandages and stuff, but that\u2019s about it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thank you for sharing that. It\u2019s important to consider those lost wages and expenses. Before we move on, I just want to confirm\u2014do you have another attorney representing you for this matter?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I don\u2019t. You\u2019re the first place I\u2019m calling."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great, that makes things easier. So, just to summarize what we\u2019ve discussed: On November 9th last year, you were injured when a KitchenPro blender exploded while you were using it, resulting in cuts on your hand that required stitches. You reported the incident to the store, but they didn\u2019t seem to take it seriously, and you didn\u2019t get any insurance information from them. You missed a few days of work and incurred some minor expenses. Is that correct?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, that sounds right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Perfect! I\u2019ll pass this information along to one of our attorneys who will review it and get back to you. They might have some more questions or need additional details, but this is a good start. Do you have any questions for me at this point?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, just one. How do your fees work?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great question! We work on a contingency fee basis, which means we only get paid if you win your case. If that happens, our fee would be a percentage of the settlement or judgment. So you won\u2019t have to worry about any upfront costs."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Okay, that sounds fair. Thanks for explaining that."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Of course! I\u2019m glad I could help. Is there anything else you\u2019d like to discuss today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I think that\u2019s it for now. I\u2019ll just wait to hear back."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Sounds good! Thank you for calling Morgan & Associates, and I hope you have a great rest of your day. We\u2019ll be in touch soon!"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Thank you, Carlos! Bye!"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Bye!"}], "outcome_status": "settled", "outcome_value": 60000}

How can I assist you today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Hi, um, yeah, I need help with a case... it\u2019s about a product that, um, it hurt me."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m really sorry to hear that. I\u2019d be happy to gather some information so we can see how we can assist you. Can you tell me a little more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, so, um, it was on July 10th last year. I bought this... this blender, right? And, um, it just exploded while I was using it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Oh wow, that sounds really scary! So, just to clarify, you were using the blender when it exploded?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, exactly! I was making a smoothie, and then, like, it just... boom! There was glass everywhere."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really dangerous. Were you injured as a result of the explosion?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I got, um, cuts on my hands and face. Like, I had to go to the hospital, and they, uh, stitched me up and stuff."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m sorry you had to go through that. How many stitches did you end up needing?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I think it was, um, like, ten stitches on my hand and five on my face? I mean, it was a lot."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s definitely significant. Did you have any follow-up treatments after that initial hospital visit?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I had to go back a couple of times for check-ups. They gave me some pain meds too... um, I think I still have some of those left."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it. So, you mentioned you were using a blender. Did you happen to keep the receipt or any packaging from the blender?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I think I threw the box away, but I might have the receipt somewhere in my email or something."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That could be helpful. And do you remember the brand or model of the blender?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, it was a... uh, Ninja blender? I think that\u2019s what it was called."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great, that\u2019s helpful to know. Now, um, regarding the incident, do you recall if there were any witnesses around when the blender exploded?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Not really. I was home alone, so, um, no witnesses."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, understood. That could make things a bit trickier. Did you report this incident to the company or the store where you bought the blender?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I, um, I called the store, but they just, like, brushed me off. I don\u2019t think they really cared."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s frustrating to hear. Did you happen to exchange any information with the store, like their insurance or anything like that?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I didn\u2019t. They, um, didn\u2019t seem interested in helping me, so I didn\u2019t bother."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s understandable. Now, just to clarify, you mentioned going to the hospital\u2014did you have any issues with... um, like, getting treatment in a timely manner?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, it took a while. I, um, waited for a couple of hours before they saw me."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I can see how that would be frustrating, especially given the situation. Now, I also wanted to check if you've talked to any other attorneys about this incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven\u2019t. You\u2019re the first people I\u2019m calling about it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, thanks for that information. I want to make sure I have everything clear. So, to summarize, you were using a Ninja blender on July 10, 2022, and it exploded, causing cuts that required stitches. You didn\u2019t have any witnesses, and it seems like the store wasn't very helpful. Is that a fair summary?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, that\u2019s right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thank you for confirming that. Now, regarding fees, we work on a contingency fee basis, which means you won\u2019t owe us anything unless we recover money for you. Does that sound good?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, yeah, that sounds good."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Perfect! I\u2019ll pass all this information along to one of our attorneys who will review it and get back to you. Do you have a preferred way to be contacted, like a phone number or email?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, yeah, you can just call me at my number. It\u2019s 602-555-1234."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it! Thank you for that. Is there anything else you\u2019d like to add or ask before we wrap up?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I think that\u2019s it. Just, um, I hope you guys can help me."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "We\u2019ll do our best! Thank you for reaching out today, and I hope you feel better soon.

How can I assist you today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Hi, um, I was hoping to get some help with a, like, accident I had a little while ago."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Of course! I'm here to help. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, so, it was on February 27th, I think? I was at this store in Atlanta, and I slipped on, like, a wet floor. Didn\u2019t see any signs or anything."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Oh no, that sounds really painful. I'm sorry you had to go through that. Just to clarify, was the store, um, a grocery store or something else?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, it was a grocery store\u2014like one of those big chains, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it. And when you slipped, did you notice if there were any employees around or if there were any warning signs about the wet floor?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, no, not really. It was, like, right in the middle of the aisle. I think there was a sign, but it was far away. I definitely didn\u2019t see it when I walked in."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That makes sense. It\u2019s important for businesses to keep their customers informed about hazards. Were you injured when you fell?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I, um, I hurt my back and my wrist. It was pretty bad\u2014like, I had to go to the hospital and everything."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m really sorry to hear that. Did you get a diagnosis from the hospital or any follow-up treatment?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, they said I had a sprain in my wrist and some strain in my back. They gave me some pain meds and told me to do physical therapy."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds tough. Have you been able to continue with physical therapy?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I started, but then, like, I missed a few appointments because I was, uh, busy with work and stuff."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I understand. It can be hard to balance everything. How have your injuries affected your daily life or work since the accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Well, I can\u2019t lift heavy things anymore, which is a problem for my job, and it just, like, hurts to sit at my desk for too long."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s definitely frustrating. Have you had any out-of-pocket expenses related to your treatment, like medical bills or therapy sessions?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I\u2019ve paid a bit for the therapy, and, um, the hospital bill was pretty high too. I\u2019m still trying to figure out how to handle it all."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I can imagine that must be overwhelming. Did you happen to exchange insurance information with the store after the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I think I did. They gave me, um, a claim number, and I spoke to their insurance. But I don\u2019t remember the name of the company."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s okay. It\u2019s common to forget those details in the moment. Do you remember if the store was part of a larger chain? Sometimes that can help narrow down the insurance provider."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I think it is, like, part of a national chain, but I\u2019m not sure how that helps."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "It can help us figure out their standard insurance practices. Have you had a chance to reach out to any other attorneys about this case?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven\u2019t. I was just, like, looking for some advice first."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That makes sense. I appreciate you reaching out to us. Just to confirm, you mentioned that the store didn\u2019t have proper warning signs, which could be a key factor in establishing liability."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I really don\u2019t think they did, and I, um, felt like it was their fault for not keeping the area safe."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Definitely. It sounds like you have a solid basis for a claim. Now, do you have any specific questions about what to expect next in the process?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, yeah, I guess I\u2019m just wondering how all of this works? Like, what happens next?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Sure! Once I gather all this information, I\u2019ll pass it along to one of our attorneys who will review your case. They may reach out to you for further details or clarification. If they think you have a valid claim, they\u2019ll discuss the next steps with you."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Okay, sounds good. And, like, how do you charge for this?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "We work on a contingency fee basis, which means we only get paid if you win your case. So there's no upfront cost to you."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh, that\u2019s a relief! I was worried about that."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I completely understand. It\u2019s important to know there won\u2019t be any financial pressure while you pursue your case. So, just to recap, you slipped and fell at a grocery store in Atlanta on February 27th. You suffered a wrist sprain and back strain, and you\u2019re currently undergoing physical therapy. You think the store was at fault due to a lack of proper warning signs, and you were able to exchange insurance info but don\u2019t remember the company name. Is that all accurate?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, that sounds right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great!

How can I assist you today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Hi Brenda. Um, I wanted to talk about, like, a dog bite incident I had a little while ago."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I'm really sorry to hear that. Dog bites can be really serious. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Sure. It was, um, November 30th last year, I think. I was walking in my neighborhood in Colorado when this dog just, like, ran up to me and bit my leg."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Oh no, that sounds really scary. Was the dog on a leash at the time?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I don\u2019t think so. I mean, I was, like, just minding my own business, and then it just came out of nowhere."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I can imagine how alarming that must have been. Do you know if the dog had an owner nearby?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, there was a guy, um, he was, like, trying to call the dog back. I think he was the owner."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Did you happen to exchange any information with the owner? Like, did you get their name or insurance details?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, I think I did. I mean, I got his name, but the insurance part is... um, I'm not really sure. I might have written it down somewhere."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That's understandable. It can be hard to keep track of everything in those moments. What was the owner's name, if you remember?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I think it was, um, Mike? No, wait, it was Mark! Yeah, Mark."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! And just to clarify, do you recall what kind of dog it was?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh, um, it was a big dog. Like, a German Shepherd, maybe? Or, wait, it could have been a mix."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it\u2014sounds like a big dog, for sure. Now, how were you feeling after the incident? Did you seek any medical treatment?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, well, I didn\u2019t go right away. I thought it was just a scratch, but then it got worse. I went to the ER a few days later."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I'm sorry to hear that it got worse. What kind of treatment did they provide you at the ER?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "They, like, cleaned the wound and gave me some antibiotics. I also got a tetanus shot, I think?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds important. And how would you describe the injuries you sustained overall? Are you still dealing with any pain or complications?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, um, it still hurts sometimes, especially if I, like, bump it or something. But, I mean, it\u2019s not terrible, I guess."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s good to hear it\u2019s not too bad, but it\u2019s still concerning that you're having lingering pain. Have you been able to document your medical visits, like with bills or treatment records?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I have some paperwork from the ER visit. I just haven\u2019t organized it all yet."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s completely understandable. It can be a lot to manage after an incident like this. Now, do you know if the owner had any insurance that might cover your medical expenses?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I think he mentioned something about insurance, but I didn\u2019t catch the name. Maybe it was, like, State Farm? I\u2019m not sure."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "No worries, that\u2019s helpful to know. It sounds like there might be some coverage, but we\u2019ll need to look into that further.

I just wanted to see what my options are first."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s a smart approach. I\u2019ll make sure to pass all of this information to one of our attorneys for a review. Just to recap, we have that the incident happened on November 30th last year in Colorado, involving a dog that bit your leg. You\u2019ve received medical treatment after a few days, and while you may have some documentation, it\u2019s not fully organized yet."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, that sounds right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Perfect. Do you have any questions about our process or what happens next?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, not really? I guess I\u2019m just wondering about fees?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Absolutely! We work on a contingency fee basis, which means you won\u2019t pay anything unless we\u2019re able to recover compensation for you."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh, that\u2019s good to know!"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Yes! I\u2019ll make sure to pass on everything we discussed to one of our attorneys, and they\u2019ll reach out to you soon to discuss the next steps.

I\u2019ll make sure to note that down.

How can I assist you today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Hi, um, my name is Lisa. I was involved in an accident last week, and I think I might need a lawyer."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Hi, Lisa! I\u2019m sorry to hear about your accident. Can you tell me a little more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Sure. So, it was on October 11th, and I was at this, um, shopping plaza in Miami. I tripped over a loose tile in the walkway."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Oh no, that sounds painful! Were there any witnesses around when the accident occurred?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, there were a few people nearby. I think one of them even helped me get up."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s good to know! Did you happen to exchange any information with them or maybe get their names?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I didn\u2019t think about that at the time. I was just, um, really focused on my injury."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I understand. It can be overwhelming in those moments. Can you describe how you were feeling after the fall? Did you notice any injuries right away?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, my ankle really hurt, and I, um, fell hard on my knee too. It was pretty bad. I ended up going to the hospital later that day because the pain was just too much."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m sorry to hear that, Lisa. Did the doctors give you a diagnosis at the hospital?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "They said I have a sprained ankle and some bruising on my knee. They gave me a brace for my ankle and told me to rest."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds rough. Have you had any previous issues with your ankle or knee before this accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Well, I did twist my ankle a couple of years ago, but nothing like this. I\u2019ve never had a serious injury or anything."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thanks for clarifying that. It\u2019s important to understand your medical history. Did you have to miss work because of the injury?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I\u2019ve missed a few days already. I work as a receptionist, so it\u2019s hard to sit at my desk with my ankle all swollen."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That must be frustrating. Have you kept track of any medical expenses or lost wages so far?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, yes. I got the bill from the hospital, and I\u2019ve missed about three days of work, which is a big hit for me."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I can imagine. It\u2019s really important to document everything. Now, did you happen to get any information about the property owner or the shopping plaza? Like, do you know if they have insurance?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I didn\u2019t ask them specifically, but I heard someone mention that the plaza has insurance for these kinds of accidents."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s helpful to know. Do you remember the name of the plaza or the property management company?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "It\u2019s called the Coral Square Plaza or something like that. I don\u2019t know the management company, though."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "No worries, that\u2019s a great starting point. Have you had a chance to talk to anyone else about your case, like another attorney?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, you\u2019re the first lawyer I\u2019m reaching out to. I just want to know if I have a case or, like, what my options are."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I completely understand. Our attorneys will review the details and see if there\u2019s a good basis for a case. Just to let you know, we work on a contingency fee basis, which means you won\u2019t owe us anything unless we win your case."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh, okay! That\u2019s good to know."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! And just to recap, you tripped over a loose tile at Coral Square Plaza on October 11th, suffered a sprained ankle and bruised knee, and have already incurred medical expenses and lost wages. You didn\u2019t exchange witness information, but there may be insurance coverage through the plaza. Is that correct?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, that sounds right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Perfect, Lisa! I\u2019ll pass this information along to one of our attorneys who will review it and get back to you. Do you have any other questions in the meantime?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I think that covers everything for now.

I\u2019d be happy to help you with that. Can you tell me a little more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Sure. It was on October 28, 2021, in Austin. I was driving home from work, and, um, I think the other driver was speeding."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, so you were driving home from work, and the other driver was speeding. Were there any other circumstances you think contributed to the accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Well, um, I remember seeing them swerving a bit, but I guess I was kinda distracted too. I had, uh, just a little bit to drink earlier that evening, and I was trying to focus on the road."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I see. So, there was some distraction on both sides. It\u2019s good that you\u2019re being honest about that. Can you tell me more about how the accident happened? Like, were you at a stoplight or a stop sign when it occurred?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, so, I was at a red light, and when it turned green, I started to go, and then they just, um, came barreling through the intersection and hit me."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really scary. Did you happen to exchange insurance information with the other driver?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I got their info. They had, um, State Farm, I think, but I\u2019m not sure about their policy details."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s helpful to know. Did the police come to the scene and file a report?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, they did. I remember talking to an officer, but I didn\u2019t get a copy of the report."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "No problem. You can usually request a copy later if needed. Now, can you tell me about any injuries you sustained from the accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh, um, I got pretty banged up. I had a concussion, and my neck has been killing me since then. I also had some bruises and stuff."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really tough. Have you been able to see a doctor for your injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I went to the ER that night, and they gave me some pain meds and, like, told me to follow up with my primary care doctor."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m glad to hear you got medical attention. Have you had any ongoing treatments or therapies since the accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I\u2019ve been going to physical therapy for my neck. It\u2019s been a few months now."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "It sounds like you\u2019ve been through a lot. Now, have you had any other legal issues in the past that we should know about?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, yeah, I had a DUI a couple of years ago. I was just trying to get my life back on track since then."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I appreciate your openness about that. It\u2019s important for us to have a full picture of your situation. Are you currently working with another attorney regarding this accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I\u2019m not. I figured I\u2019d start fresh and see what my options are."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That makes sense. We work on a contingency fee basis, which means we only get paid if you win your case. Is that something you\u2019d be comfortable with?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, that sounds fair."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! Just to summarize, you were in a car accident on October 28, 2021, in Austin, where the other driver was speeding and you were at a red light. You exchanged insurance information with them, and the police filed a report. You suffered a concussion and neck pain, and you\u2019ve been going to physical therapy since then.

It, uh, happened a while ago, I think in March of 2021."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m really sorry to hear about that. Dog bites can be quite serious. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, so, um, I was at this park in Seattle and, like, I was playing with my friends. And then, um, this dog just came out of nowhere and, uh, it bit me on the leg."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really frightening. I can imagine that must have been quite painful. Do you remember what day in March it was?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uhm, I think it was the 26th? Yeah, it was the 26th."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it, March 26th. And do you know what kind of dog it was? Was it on a leash at the time?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I think it was a, um, a pit bull? I\u2019m not sure, but it was definitely a big dog. And, um, I don't think it was on a leash. It was just running around the park."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I see. That might help establish liability. Was the owner present when the incident happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, the owner was there. Um, I remember them saying something like, \u201cOh, he\u2019s friendly!\u201d But, uh, clearly he wasn\u2019t."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s really important to know. Did you happen to exchange any insurance information with the dog owner?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh, um, I don\u2019t think so. I was, like, in shock or something, and I didn\u2019t even think about it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Totally understandable. It can be overwhelming in a moment like that. Do you remember if the owner mentioned having any insurance, like homeowner\u2019s or renter\u2019s insurance?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I think they might\u2019ve said something about insurance, but I, I don\u2019t remember the details."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s alright. We can work with what we have. Now, I\u2019d like to ask about your injuries. How did you feel immediately after the bite, and did you seek any medical attention?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, it hurt a lot! I, um, went to the hospital later that day because it was bleeding. They gave me a tetanus shot and, um, cleaned the wound. I think they said it wasn\u2019t too deep."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m glad you got the care you needed. Did you have any follow-up appointments or ongoing treatment after that?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, not really. Just the one visit, I think. It, um, it hurt for a few days but then got better."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s good to hear it healed up. Were there any other damages, like lost wages or emotional distress, from the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, no, I wasn\u2019t working at the time. I was just, like, in school and stuff. I guess I was kinda scared of dogs after that, though."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That makes sense. It\u2019s completely normal to feel that way after experiencing something traumatic. Just to confirm, do you currently have any other legal representation regarding this issue?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, no. I haven\u2019t talked to anyone else about it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, great. So just to summarize what we\u2019ve discussed: the incident happened on March 26th, 2021, in Seattle, where you were bitten by a dog at a park.

It was, um, in September of 2021?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Of course! I\u2019m here to help. So, can you tell me a bit more about what happened during that incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, um, I was using this, uh, kitchen appliance\u2014like a blender or something\u2014and it, um, just exploded while I was, uh, blending. I got really hurt."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Oh no! That sounds really scary. Can you tell me more about what kind of injuries you sustained?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, yeah. I got some pretty bad cuts on my hands and, like, my face too. I had to go to the hospital, and they, um, stitched me up. It was, like, really painful, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I can imagine that must have been very painful and traumatic. Did you have to miss work because of the injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I had to take, um, about two weeks off. I work in, like, a restaurant, so it was tough. I, um, couldn\u2019t really do anything with my hands for a while."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really challenging. I\u2019m sorry to hear that. Now, regarding the blender, do you know if it was a specific brand or model? And, um, was it new or used when you bought it?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, I think it was a brand called, um, BlendPro? Yeah, I got it brand new from a store. I still have the receipt somewhere, I think."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great, having the receipt will help. Did you report the incident to the store where you purchased it or to the manufacturer?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I called the store, but they were, like, not very helpful. They just said it was my fault or something, which, um, didn\u2019t make sense. I didn\u2019t do anything wrong!"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I understand how frustrating that can be. It\u2019s important to feel heard, especially after something so serious. So, when the blender malfunctioned, was there any kind of warning or label that said how to use it safely?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Not really, no. I mean, it had the usual, um, safety instructions, but it didn\u2019t say anything about, uh, this could happen or whatever. It just\u2026 exploded out of nowhere."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Wow, that\u2019s concerning. It sounds like there might be a case for a product defect. Have you, um, kept any photos or documentation from the incident or your injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I took some pictures of my hands and the, um, blender afterward. It was, like, a mess. I can send those to you if you need them."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Definitely! Those photos will be helpful. Now, about insurance\u2014did you happen to exchange any information with the store or the manufacturer regarding liability?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I didn\u2019t get any insurance info from them. They just kinda brushed me off, you know? I don\u2019t think they want to take responsibility."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I understand that can be really frustrating. It\u2019s good to know you tried reaching out. Do you happen to know if the manufacturer has liability insurance for situations like this?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I, um, have no idea. I just assumed they would, you know? I didn't really think about that at the time."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s understandable.

Now, have you spoken to any other attorneys about this case, or are you currently working with someone?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven\u2019t talked to anyone else.

I was, um, at a friend's house, and their dog just, like, came out of nowhere and bit me."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Oh no, that sounds really scary! I hope you\u2019re okay. Can you tell me more about the dog? What breed was it, and do you know if it had a history of biting or aggression?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "It was, um, a pit bull. I don\u2019t think it had bitten anyone before. I mean, I\u2019ve been around the dog before, and it seemed fine.

And now I have this, like, nasty scar. It\u2019s, um, really painful too."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m really sorry to hear that you went through such a painful experience. Did you receive any follow-up treatment after the hospital visit?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, yeah, I had to go to physical therapy for a few months because my arm, like, wouldn\u2019t move properly. It, uh, still hurts sometimes."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really tough. I appreciate you sharing that with me. Now, regarding the dog, did you happen to get any information from the owner, like their insurance details?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, yeah, I think they had insurance. I got the name of the company, but I can't remember it right now. I just, like, wrote it down somewhere."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "No problem! It happens. If you can find that information later, it would be helpful. Did you exchange contact information with the dog owner?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I did. They were, um, really apologetic and stuff. But I don\u2019t know if they, like, reported it to their insurance or whatever."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I understand. It\u2019s good that you have their information. Now, do you know if the owner was renting or if they own the home?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, they own the house, I think. I\u2019m pretty sure they mentioned it while we were, um, talking after the bite."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! That\u2019s useful to know. Now, I also need to ask if you have any pre-existing injuries that might be relevant to this situation."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, no, not really. I...

You received stitches for a deep wound on your arm and underwent physical therapy afterwards. The dog\u2019s owner was apologetic and you exchanged contact information. You mentioned that they likely have homeowners insurance but you don\u2019t recall the name of the company just yet. Is there anything else you think I should know?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, no, I think that\u2019s it. I just hope we can, um, get this sorted out."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I completely understand, and we\u2019re here to help you with that. I\u2019ll pass all this information along to one of our attorneys who will review it and get back to you soon. You\u2019ll be in good hands."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Thank you, Brenda. I appreciate it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "You\u2019re welcome! I hope you have a great rest of your day, and we\u2019ll be in touch soon."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Okay, thanks.

How can I help you today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, hi. Um, I wanted to talk about an accident I had, um, a few weeks ago."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Of course! I'm really sorry to hear about your accident. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, so, um, I was at this party, right? It was like, um, at a friend's house in Seattle on August 29th."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it, a party at a friend's house. And what happened during the party?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "There was, um, like, a broken step on the stairs? I didn\u2019t see it, and I tripped and fell. It was really bad."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Oh no, that sounds painful! Were you injured when you fell?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I, um, I broke my wrist and, like, hurt my shoulder too. I had to go to the hospital, and they did some, um, X-rays."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really serious. I'm glad you got medical help. Did you, um, receive any treatment after that?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I had to, um, do physical therapy for my shoulder. It still hurts sometimes, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I can imagine that must be frustrating. So, about the location, do you know if your friend rented or owned the house where the party was held?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, I think they own it? Yeah, they do."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, that\u2019s helpful to know. Can you tell me if there was any kind of warning about the broken step, like a sign or anything?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, there was nothing. I mean, nobody even knew it was broken. It was just, like, an accident, I guess."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That makes sense. It sounds like the homeowner might be liable since the step was broken and there were no warnings. Did you, um, happen to get any insurance information from your friend or the homeowner?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, yeah, I think they said they had homeowners insurance. But I don't remember the company name."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "No problem! It's good that you have some insurance information. Now, have you spoken to any other attorneys about this incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I have, um, another attorney, but I\u2019m not sure if I want to stick with them."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I understand. It's important to feel comfortable with your representation. Can I ask why you\u2019re considering a change?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I just feel like they\u2019re not really, um, listening to me or taking my case seriously."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s really frustrating. You deserve to be heard. So, just to clarify, you were injured due to the broken step at your friend's house, and you have some medical treatment going on. Is that correct?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, that\u2019s right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! Now, how are you feeling about your injuries? Do you think they\u2019ll impact your daily life or work?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, definitely. I can\u2019t, um, do my job the same way right now. I\u2019m, like, a barista, and it\u2019s hard to lift stuff with my wrist and shoulder hurting."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds tough. It\u2019s understandable that you\u2019d want to pursue this further, especially if it\u2019s affecting your work. Just to recap: you fell on a broken step at a friend\u2019s house in Seattle, got hurt pretty badly, and you have another attorney but are considering a change. Is that all correct?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, that\u2019s right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Perfect! I\u2019ll pass this information along to one of our attorneys who\u2019ll review it and get back to you. They\u2019ll discuss the details of your case and any next steps. Do you have any questions for me in the meantime?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, yeah, how does, like, the fee stuff work? I\u2019m kinda worried about that."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I totally understand your concerns. We work on a contingency fee basis, which means you won\u2019t have to pay anything upfront. We only get paid if we win your case."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh, okay, that makes sense."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Absolutely! It's a way to ensure that you\u2019re not carrying any financial burden while pursuing your case. Now, can I get your contact information so we can follow up with you once the attorney reviews everything?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Sure, um, my name is... it's Jessica, and my number is 555-1234."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thanks, Jessica! Got it. And is there an email address you\u2019d like us to use as well?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, it\u2019s jessica.smith@email.com."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Perfect, thank you! We'll be in touch soon. I really appreciate you sharing all this with me today. I hope you feel better soon!"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Thanks, Carlos.

How can I help you today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, hi. Um, I\u2019m calling about an accident that happened a while ago."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I'm sorry to hear that. I\u2019d be happy to help you. Can you tell me a bit more about the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, it was, um, like, in August last year. August 20th, I think."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, so August 20th, 2021. And where did this accident happen?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "It was in Austin, Texas."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it! Austin, Texas. What kind of accident was it?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "It was a premises liability thing. I was, um, at this friend's house. They had, like, a broken railing on their porch, and I fell off it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really painful! I'm sorry you went through that. Can you tell me a little more about what happened? Were there any specific circumstances that led to your fall?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, well, I was just hanging out, you know? And I leaned against the railing, and it just, like, gave way. I wasn\u2019t doing anything crazy or anything."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really scary. So, it was the railing that was broken? Was there any warning, like a sign or anything, that indicated it was unsafe?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, there wasn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t see anything. I mean, I think it was just, like, an accident waiting to happen, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I understand. It sounds like the railing\u2019s condition was a big factor. Were there any witnesses to the accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, um, a few friends were there. They saw the whole thing."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s helpful! Now, after the fall, did you seek any medical attention?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I went to the hospital. I ended up with a broken arm and, um, some bruises, you know? It was pretty bad."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m really sorry to hear that. A broken arm must have been really tough to deal with. Did you have to undergo any surgeries or follow-up treatments?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I had to get surgery to, like, put in some pins. And then I had physical therapy for a while."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds like a lot to go through. Were you able to get any documentation from the hospital about your injuries and treatments?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I have all the paperwork from the hospital and the therapy sessions."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s great to hear. It\u2019ll be really helpful for your case. Now, did you talk to the homeowner or anyone else about the accident after it happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I told my friend who lives there, but I didn\u2019t, like, file a report or anything."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Understood. Did you happen to exchange any insurance information with the homeowner?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I think they said they had insurance, but I don\u2019t know, like, what company or anything."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s good to know they have insurance. Now, just to clarify, have you spoken to any other attorneys about this case?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven\u2019t talked to anyone else."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Alright, that\u2019s helpful information. Now, um, how have your injuries impacted your daily life? Have you had to miss school or work because of this?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I missed, like, a lot of school. I couldn\u2019t write or anything, and it was hard to, like, keep up with homework."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That must have been really challenging. Have you had any ongoing issues or concerns with your arm since the accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, yeah, it still hurts sometimes, especially when I, like, try to lift stuff."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m sorry to hear that. It sounds like it\u2019s been a long road to recovery. Now, just to confirm, how old are you?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I\u2019m 16."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thank you for sharing that. I appreciate your openness. Since you\u2019re a minor, we\u2019ll need to involve a parent or guardian in this process. Can you let me know if there\u2019s someone we should reach out to?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I can have my mom talk to you."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Perfect! I\u2019ll need to get some contact information for her. And just to summarize, we\u2019ve gathered that you had an accident on August 20, 2021, in Austin, Texas, involving a broken railing, which led to a broken arm and some bruises. You had surgery and physical therapy, and you haven't spoken to any other attorneys. Did I miss anything?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, that sounds right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! I\u2019ll pass this information along to one of our attorneys who will review it and get back to you. Before we wrap up, do you have any questions for me about the process or anything else?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, not really. I guess just, like, what happens next?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Sure! After I pass your information to an attorney, they\u2019ll review everything and decide on the next steps. They might reach out to your mom to discuss things further. Just remember, we work on a contingency fee basis, which means you won\u2019t owe anything unless we win your case."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Okay, that sounds good."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Perfect! Thank you for sharing all this information with me today. I hope you have a good rest of your day, and we\u2019ll be in touch soon!"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Thanks, Brenda!"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "You\u2019re welcome!

I\u2019m sorry to hear about the situation. Can you tell me a little more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, um, so this happened back in December, like, the first of December in 2021? I was walking in my neighborhood in Austin, Texas, and, um, this dog just came running out of a yard and, like, bit my leg."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Oh no, that sounds really painful! I can imagine that must have been quite a shock. Do you remember what kind of dog it was?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I think it was a pit bull, but I\u2019m not, like, completely sure. It was big and kinda aggressive, for sure."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s definitely concerning. Did the owner of the dog come outside when the incident happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, they did! I think they were pretty shocked too. Um, they said they were sorry and that the dog had never done anything like that before."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I see. Did you manage to get any insurance information from the dog owner?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I think so. They gave me their name, but I can't remember it right now. They mentioned they had insurance, but I, um, didn\u2019t catch the name of the company."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Not a problem! It happens. Did you happen to take any pictures of your injuries or the scene?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh, yeah! I took a couple of pictures of my leg. It was pretty swollen and, uh, had some bite marks. I also took a picture of the dog, I think."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s great that you have evidence. It can really help with your case. How would you describe your injuries? Did you have to seek medical attention?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, yeah, I went to the ER because it hurt a lot. They, like, cleaned the wound and gave me a tetanus shot, but, um, I didn't need stitches or anything."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m glad to hear that it wasn\u2019t more serious, but it sounds like it was still quite a painful experience. Have you had any ongoing issues since the incident, like pain or trouble moving your leg?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, sometimes it still hurts, especially if I, um, walk a lot. I thought it would get better, but it\u2019s been hurting off and on since then."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds frustrating. Have you had any follow-up appointments with a doctor to check on your leg?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven't really gone back since the ER. I kinda thought it would just heal on its own, but, um, maybe I should."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "It might be a good idea to check in with a doctor just to be sure. Now, regarding the insurance, did the dog owner say anything about how their insurance might handle the situation?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Not really. They just, um, apologized again and said they would take care of it, but I don\u2019t think I got any details."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Understood. It can be tough to get all the information in the moment. Just to clarify, have you talked to any other attorneys about this?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven\u2019t. I\u2019m kinda, like, just trying to figure out what to do next."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s perfectly okay! We\u2019re here to help you through this process. So, just to summarize, you were bitten by a dog in Austin on December 1st, 2021. You sought medical attention at the ER, and you have some ongoing pain in your leg. You spoke briefly with the dog owner, who mentioned insurance but didn't provide the details. Does that sound right?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, that sounds about right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! What will happen next is I\u2019ll pass this information to one of our attorneys. They\u2019ll review the details, and then we\u2019ll reach out to you to discuss your options. Also, just so you know, we work on a contingency fee basis, so if we take your case, you won\u2019t owe us anything unless we recover money for you."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Okay, that\u2019s good to know. Thank you!"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "You\u2019re welcome! Is there anything else you\u2019d like to ask me while we\u2019re on the phone?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, no, I think that\u2019s it for now. Thanks for your help, Brenda!"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Of course, Jenna! I hope you feel better soon, and we\u2019ll be in touch once the attorney has had a chance to review your case. Have a great day!"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "You too!

Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, um, so it was on October 25th, I think. I was, like, driving in Phoenix... and, um, I got hit by this guy. It was kind of crazy."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really stressful. Can you tell me more about how the accident happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Right, so, um, I was at a red light, and then I think the guy behind me just... didn\u2019t stop? Like, he slammed into me! I was just sitting there, and then boom!"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Wow, that must have been quite a shock. Did you get a chance to exchange information with the other driver?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, we did. Uh, he gave me his insurance info. I think it was, um, State Farm? Yeah, State Farm."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great, that\u2019s helpful. And do you know if he was at fault for the accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Well, I mean, he hit me from behind, so I\u2019d say yeah, right? But, um, he was saying something about me stopping too suddenly, but, like, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That makes sense. It\u2019s typically assumed the driver in the rear is at fault in those situations. Have you been able to see a doctor for your injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh, yeah! I went to the hospital, um, right after it happened. They said I had some whiplash and, like, a concussion. Super painful, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re dealing with that. Whiplash and concussions can be serious injuries. Have you been following up with any specialists since your hospital visit?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, yeah, I saw a doctor last week. They, um, said it might take a while to heal. They gave me some meds too, but I can\u2019t remember what they were called."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s understandable. It\u2019s good you\u2019re getting some medical attention. Are you currently facing any, um, challenges related to your recovery?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Well, yeah. I can\u2019t really work right now, and my head hurts all the time. Plus, my car is totally wrecked."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really tough. Have you had any discussions with your insurance or the other driver\u2019s insurance about your damages or lost wages?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I called my insurance, but they were kinda useless. I haven\u2019t talked to State Farm yet. I think I should, though, to see if they\u2019ll cover anything?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "It\u2019s definitely worth reaching out to them. Just to clarify, have you spoken to any other attorney about this accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, not yet. I wasn\u2019t sure if I needed one."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s completely okay. Many people feel that way at first. I can help you with some questions about your case. Can you tell me more about the extent of your damages? Like, has your car been repaired or are there any costs you\u2019re dealing with?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh, um, I think it\u2019s totaled. I\u2019m pretty sure. The tow truck guy said it looked bad. So, like, I\u2019m gonna have to get a new one, which is, um, expensive, I think."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "It sounds like you're dealing with a lot right now. I can imagine that the thought of getting a new car is stressful on top of everything else. Did you happen to take any photos of the accident scene or your vehicle afterwards?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I took some pictures on my phone, um, but I can\u2019t find them now. I think I saved them somewhere... but, like, it was really wrecked, for sure."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s okay, it happens! Photos can be helpful if you find them later. Just to recap, you were in a car accident on October 25th in Phoenix, where the other driver hit you while you were stopped at a red light.

I, uh, have a situation I wanted to discuss regarding an accident I had about three years ago."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Hi Jenna! I\u2019m really sorry to hear that you\u2019ve been dealing with this. Could you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Sure! So, um, it was on September 24, 2020. I was visiting a friend\u2019s apartment in Atlanta, and I slipped on some water that was on the floor in the hallway. There were no signs or anything to warn me."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really frustrating! So, just to clarify, you were inside the apartment complex when you slipped?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, exactly. It was in the common hallway area, not inside the apartment itself."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it! And was there any kind of maintenance or anything going on in the building at that time? Like, um, were there any workers around or any reason the water was on the floor?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, there wasn\u2019t any maintenance happening. I think it was just from someone spilling something or maybe from the rain outside. It was a pretty rainy day."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I see. So, you mentioned slipping on water. Did you injure yourself when you fell?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I, um, I hurt my ankle pretty badly. I ended up going to the hospital, and they told me it was a sprain. I was in a lot of pain for weeks, and I had to use crutches for a while."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really tough, Jenna. I hope you\u2019re feeling better now. Did you have to miss work because of your injury?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I had to take about two weeks off. It was hard, you know, managing the pain and then not being able to work. I also had some medical bills from the hospital visit."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I can imagine that must\u2019ve been stressful. Did you happen to get any information from your friend\u2019s apartment complex about their insurance or if they have liability coverage?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I didn\u2019t ask them directly. I just figured since it was their building, they would have insurance. But, um, I didn\u2019t get any specifics on that, like the name of the insurance company."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "No problem, that happens. It sounds like there\u2019s a strong case for liability since there were no warnings about the water. Did you happen to take any pictures of the scene or anything like that?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes! I took a picture of the hallway after I fell. I wanted to show my friend what happened. You can see the water on the floor in the photo."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s really helpful! Having evidence like that can be valuable. Have you spoken to any other attorneys about this situation, or are we the first ones you\u2019re reaching out to?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, you\u2019re the first.

Just to summarize what we\u2019ve discussed: you slipped in a hallway at your friend\u2019s apartment complex on September 24, 2020, and you injured your ankle, which required medical attention and caused you to miss work.

How can I assist you today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Hi, um, I wanted to talk about an accident I had at a friend's house."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Of course! I\u2019m really sorry to hear that. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, it was on May 27th, 2024. I was at my friend\u2019s place in Miami, and I slipped on some wet tiles in their bathroom."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds painful! Were there any warning signs, like a wet floor sign, or was it just kind of unexpected?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, there was nothing. I didn't even see it coming. I just lost my footing and fell hard."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Ouch! I can imagine that must have hurt a lot. Did you end up getting medical treatment?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I did. I went to the emergency room right after. They said I had a concussion and some pretty bad bruises. I was out of work for a couple of weeks too."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I'm really sorry to hear that. It sounds like you went through quite a bit. Did you have to follow up with any doctors after the ER visit?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I went to a neurologist for a while to check on the concussion. I also had physical therapy for my back\u2014it's still kinda sore."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s tough. Physical therapy can be a long process. Do you know if your friend had any homeowner's insurance that might cover this incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, I think so. I didn\u2019t get the details, though. They mentioned something about it, but I didn\u2019t really catch the name of the insurance company."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "It\u2019s okay! It\u2019s pretty common to forget those details in the moment. Did you exchange insurance information with your friend or get any documentation about the accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, we didn\u2019t exchange info. I just kind of assumed they would handle it since it was their place."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That makes sense. Just to clarify, do you have any other representation for this situation, or have you spoken to any other attorneys?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven\u2019t talked to anyone else yet."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great, that makes things a bit easier. Now, regarding the injuries, aside from the concussion and the bruises, have you experienced any other issues, like missed time from work or ongoing medical expenses?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, like I said, I missed about two weeks of work. I\u2019m still getting physical therapy, and that\u2019s adding up. I also had to buy some pain medication."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Understood. It sounds like you\u2019ve been dealing with a lot of medical expenses. Have you kept any records or receipts for those treatments?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I have everything documented. I made sure to keep track of the bills and stuff."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s really important. Keeping thorough records can help a lot down the line. Just to touch on the incident again, do you feel there was any negligence on your friend's part, like not maintaining the bathroom properly?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I think so. I mean, the tiles were really slippery, and they should\u2019ve known better to put down a mat or something."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That definitely sounds like a concern. It\u2019s important to establish liability in these cases. Now that we have a clearer picture, I\u2019ll pass this information along to one of our attorneys, who will review it and get back to you."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "That sounds good. What should I expect next?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "You can expect a call from one of our attorneys within the next few days. They\u2019ll discuss your situation in more detail and help you understand your options moving forward. Also, we work on a contingency fee basis, which means you won\u2019t have to pay anything upfront.

I\u2019d like to gather some details so we can see how we can assist you. Can you tell me when this happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, it was, um, May 10th, 2024."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it. And where did this incident take place?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "It was in Austin, Texas, um, at a park near my house."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thank you for that. Can you walk me through what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Sure, um, I was, like, playing with my friends and, uh, this dog just came out of nowhere and, um, jumped on me. I think, uh, it bit my arm."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really scary! I\u2019m sorry you had to go through that. Do you know if the dog was, um, on a leash or anything like that?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, um, it wasn\u2019t on a leash. The owner was, like, standing there, but they didn\u2019t do anything to stop it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "So, it sounds like the owner was present. Did you get their information? Like, did they give you their name or any insurance details?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I think the owner's name was, uh, Jake or something. I, um, didn\u2019t get the insurance info, but I, like, told my mom about it, and she, um, said she\u2019d try to find out more."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s understandable. It\u2019s a tough situation, especially for a minor. Did you or your mom happen to take any pictures of the injuries or, um, anything at the scene?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I think she took a photo of my arm, but, uh, it\u2019s not that bad. Just a, um, a small bite mark, but it hurt a lot!"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I can imagine! It\u2019s important to document that, even if it seems minor. Have you seen a doctor or gotten any treatment for it?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I went to the urgent care, and they, like, cleaned it up and gave me some medicine. They told me to watch for, um, infection."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s good to hear you got treatment. Have you had any ongoing pain or issues from it since then?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Not really. It, um, hurt for a few days, but now it\u2019s mostly just, um, a little sore sometimes."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, that\u2019s helpful to know. Now, um, was there any sort of, like, substance use involved? You mentioned your mom was there, right?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, she was there, but, um, I don\u2019t think she was drinking or anything. I think the owner, um, might have been, like, drinking a little, but I\u2019m not sure."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s really important information. Thank you for sharing that. Do you happen to know if the dog owner has any homeowner's or renter's insurance?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I, um, I don't know. My mom was gonna ask, but I think they're just, like, renting a place."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s understandable. Getting the insurance details can be tricky sometimes. Now, just to confirm, have you spoken to any other attorneys about this incident, or are you just reaching out to us?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, um, you\u2019re the first law firm I\u2019m, like, talking to about it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great!

Can you tell me a little more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I was at a grocery store in Colorado on August 10th. I, um, slipped on some spilled juice near the checkout line. I didn\u2019t see it at all, and I fell pretty hard."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really painful. I hope you\u2019re doing okay now. Did you seek any medical attention after the fall?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I went to the hospital the same day. They checked me out and said I had a sprained wrist and some bruising on my side. It hurt a lot, and I\u2019m still having trouble using my wrist properly."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really frustrating, especially with the pain and limited mobility. Have you been able to follow up with any doctors or specialists since then?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I went to my primary care doctor a week later, and they prescribed some pain medication and recommended physical therapy, which I\u2019ve just started."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m glad to hear you\u2019re getting some treatment. It\u2019s important to take care of yourself. Now, can I ask you about the circumstances of the slip? Was there anyone else around when it happened, or did you notice if there were any signs of warning?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "There were a few people in line, but I don\u2019t think anyone saw me fall. I didn\u2019t see any warning signs, and no one came to check on me right away. It was just really slippery."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I see. It\u2019s good to note that there weren\u2019t any warnings present. Did you happen to speak to anyone at the store afterward, like a manager or employee?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I talked to a manager after I got up. He seemed concerned and asked if I was okay. I told him I wasn\u2019t, and he took my information, but he didn\u2019t offer me anything else."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s understandable. Did you exchange any information with the store, like their insurance details or anything like that?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I think he mentioned something about their insurance, but I didn\u2019t get any specific details. I was just focused on my injury."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s completely understandable. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to think of those details when you\u2019re in shock. Do you remember the name of the grocery store?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, it was a Safeway."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great, thank you for that.

Are there any other damages you\u2019ve experienced, like lost wages or anything like that?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Well, I had to take a week off work because I couldn\u2019t use my wrist at all. I work as a cashier, so it\u2019s been tough not being able to do my job."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I can imagine that\u2019s been really challenging for you.

I'm glad you got medical attention. Did you, um, seek treatment right away, or was there a delay?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Well, I didn\u2019t go immediately. I thought it was just a sprain like I said, but after a couple of days, it wasn\u2019t getting better, so I went to the ER. They did an X-ray and found the fracture."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "It\u2019s understandable to think it was just a sprain at first. So, did you report the incident to the property management or the owner of the complex?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I reported it to the management office the day it happened. They, um, said they were gonna look into it, but I don\u2019t think anything was ever done about the broken step."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I see. That\u2019s important information. Did you happen to exchange any insurance information with the management or the property owner?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Not really. They didn\u2019t give me any insurance details, but, um, I think they might have some kind of liability coverage."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, that\u2019s good to know. Did you take any photos of the broken step or the area where you fell?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I took some pictures. They were on my phone, but I\u2019m not sure if I still have them. It was, um, a while ago."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s understandable. Photos can be really helpful if we move forward with this. Can you tell me more about your injuries? Have you had any ongoing issues with your wrist or knee since the accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Well, the wrist healed up, but I still have some pain in my knee, especially when I, like, bend it too much. I\u2019ve been doing physical therapy for that."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m sorry to hear that you're still in pain. Physical therapy can be helpful, though. Have you had any medical bills from the treatment or any other expenses related to the accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I\u2019ve had some bills, but, um, I haven\u2019t really kept track of them all. The hospital visit was expensive, and the therapy adds up too."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That makes sense. It\u2019s important to keep track of those expenses.

That sounds really distressing. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, it was on January 26th, I think. I was walking in my neighborhood in Phoenix. There was this, um, dog that just came running out of its yard and, uh, it bit me."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really frightening. I'm glad you're okay. Can you describe the dog at all? Like, what breed it was or if it had any distinguishing features?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, it was a medium-sized, uh, brown dog. I think it was a Labrador mix or something. It wasn\u2019t on a leash, and I\u2019m pretty sure it was just in the yard."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I see. So, it sounds like the dog was not being properly contained. Did you have any interaction with the dog's owner or anyone else there at the time?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, the owner came out right after it happened.

They gave me their name, I think it was, uh, Mike, but I didn\u2019t get their last name. But, um, they told me they had insurance. I didn\u2019t ask for the details, though."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s okay! It\u2019s common in these situations.

How did you feel right after the bite, and have you sought any medical attention?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Well, at first, it was just, like, a sharp pain, and, um, I noticed it was bleeding a bit. I went to urgent care later that day because it was, uh, swelling up. They cleaned it and gave me some antibiotics."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That makes sense. It\u2019s good that you got treatment. Have you had any follow-ups or ongoing issues since then?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I\u2019ve had, um, some pain, and it\u2019s still a bit sore. I\u2019m worried it might leave a scar or something."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I understand your concern about that. Scarring can be a big issue with dog bites. Have you missed any work or had any other impacts on your daily life because of this?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I did miss a couple of days, but I\u2019m back to work now. It hasn\u2019t affected, like, my job too much, but it does hurt when I, um, try to lift things."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I appreciate you sharing that.

My name is Carlos, and I'm here to help you today. How can I assist you?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, hey Carlos. I, like, I had this incident with a dog a while back, and I\u2019m not sure what to do about it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m really sorry to hear that. Dog bites can be pretty serious. Can you tell me a little more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, so, uh, it was on August 29, 2021, and it was, um, in Denver. I was just walking in the park, and this dog, like, just came charging at me. I didn\u2019t even see it coming!"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really frightening! Was the dog on a leash at the time, or was it wandering free?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh, um, it was off-leash. The owner was, like, just standing there, not paying attention. The dog, uh, bit me on the leg."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Ouch! I can only imagine how painful that must have been. Did you seek any medical treatment for your injury?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I went to the hospital. They, like, cleaned the wound and gave me some shots. I had to go back a couple of times, too."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m glad you got the care you needed. How would you describe your injuries? Have they healed up since then?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, well, it was pretty bad at first. I had bruising and, like, some swelling. It took a while, but it\u2019s mostly healed now, although I still have a scar."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Scars can be a tough reminder. Did you have to miss work or anything because of your injury?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I missed, like, a week. I work part-time at a coffee shop, so it wasn\u2019t great for my income."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I understand. That\u2019s definitely frustrating. Now, regarding the dog and its owner, do you know if they had any kind of insurance, like homeowners or renters insurance?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I think the owner mentioned they had renters insurance? But I\u2019m not sure if that covers dog bites or whatever."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "It\u2019s possible that renters insurance could cover that, but we can look into it more. Did you manage to get any insurance information from the owner at the time of the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I, um, think I got their name and number, but I didn\u2019t, like, write down the insurance info. It was all kind of chaotic."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That makes sense; it can be a lot to handle in the moment. Since you mentioned it was chaotic, can you tell me more about the circumstances surrounding the incident? Were there any witnesses around?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, there were a couple of people nearby. They, um, saw the whole thing happen. I think one of them even talked to the owner after it happened."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That could be important for your case. Do you happen to know if you can reach those witnesses again?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I, um, think I could. I didn\u2019t get their names, but I saw them at the park a few times after the incident."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s good to hear. Witnesses can really help establish what happened. Now, I have to ask, do you currently have another attorney representing you for this case?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I went to see someone, but it didn\u2019t feel right. I, like, haven\u2019t signed anything with them yet, though."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s completely understandable. It\u2019s important to find the right fit. If you decide to move forward with us, we can help you through this process. Now, have you had any prior legal issues or anything that might affect your case?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, yeah, I had some stuff a while back, but it\u2019s all sorted out now. It was, like, a different situation, but I\u2019m not sure if it matters."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "It can sometimes be relevant, but don\u2019t worry\u2014we can discuss it more in detail if you choose to work with us. Just to clarify, how did you feel about the dog owner's liability in this situation? Do you think they were negligent?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Well, yeah, I mean, they should have had the dog on a leash, right? It was, like, their fault for not controlling it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "It does sound like there\u2019s a case for negligence there. Thank you for sharing that. So just to summarize, you were bitten by a dog while walking in a park in Denver on August 29, 2021. You received medical treatment, and while you missed some work, you\u2019re mostly healed now, though you do have a scar. You think the owner had renters insurance, but you haven\u2019t confirmed that. You also mentioned there were witnesses, and you currently have a different attorney but haven't signed anything with them."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, that all sounds right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! I\u2019ll pass this information along to one of our attorneys, who will review it and get back to you. We operate on a contingency fee basis, which means you won\u2019t owe us anything unless we recover money for you. Do you have any other questions for me in the meantime?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, no, I think that covers it. Thanks for your help, Carlos!"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "You\u2019re welcome! I\u2019m glad I could help. We\u2019ll be in touch soon, and take care of yourself in the meantime!"}], "outcome_status": "dropped", "outcome_value": 0}

How can I assist you today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Hi, um, I\u2019m calling because I, uh, had an accident a while back and I\u2019m not really sure what to do next."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m sorry to hear that. It sounds frustrating. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, it was on February 4th this year. I was at this, um, like a shopping plaza in Phoenix. I slipped and fell in a store."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Oh no, that sounds painful! What did you slip on, if you remember?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "There was, uh, some kind of liquid on the floor. I think it was, like, a spilled drink or something. I didn\u2019t see it until it was too late."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I see. So, you mentioned slipping on a liquid. Did you notice if there were any signs or anything to warn customers about the wet floor?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, no, I don\u2019t think so. I mean, there might\u2019ve been, but I really don\u2019t remember seeing any."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it. That\u2019s important to know. Were there any employees around when you fell? Did anyone come over to help you afterward?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, there were a couple of employees nearby. They came over pretty quickly. I think they called, um, someone to check on me."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s good to hear. Did you happen to get their names or any information about them?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I didn\u2019t. I was kind of in shock, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Understandable. It can be overwhelming in those moments. Did you end up needing medical attention after the fall?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I, um, I hurt my wrist pretty badly. I went to the urgent care later that day, and they told me it was sprained."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m sorry to hear that! Did you have any follow-up appointments or treatments for your wrist after that initial visit?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I had a couple of follow-ups and some physical therapy for a few weeks. It\u2019s still kinda sore sometimes."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds tough. I hope it heals up soon. Now, do you know if the store has insurance that might cover your injuries? Did you manage to get any information from them?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I think they mentioned something about insurance, but I didn\u2019t get any details. I was too focused on my injury at the time."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s totally understandable. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to think of those things in the moment. Do you remember the name of the store where this happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, it was a, um, big chain store, I think it was called \u201cSuperMart.\u201d"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great, that helps. Have you spoken to anyone else about this incident or consulted with another attorney?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven\u2019t talked to anyone else. I didn\u2019t really know if I should or not."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s okay. We\u2019re here to help you figure it out. Now, since you mentioned you\u2019re a minor, are you speaking on behalf of a parent or guardian?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, my mom is helping me with this. She\u2019s, um, really concerned about the whole thing."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That makes sense. Having someone to support you through this is important. Can I ask if your mom is aware of this call and the details we\u2019re discussing?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, she knows I\u2019m calling. She\u2019s right here with me, actually."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s good to know. It\u2019s always better when family is involved. Now, can you tell me if you\u2019ve had any prior legal issues or accidents before this one?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, no, not really. This is the first time something like this has happened to me."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thank you for sharing that. It\u2019s helpful to know. Just to clarify, are you comfortable if I pass all this information along to one of our attorneys? They can review it and see how we might be able to assist you further."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, that\u2019s fine. I just want to make sure I\u2019m doing the right thing."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Absolutely, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re here for! To recap, you slipped on a liquid at SuperMart in Phoenix on February 4th and injured your wrist. You received medical attention and are still experiencing some soreness. You didn\u2019t get any insurance details from the store, and you haven\u2019t spoken to any other attorneys. Plus, your mom is involved in this process with you."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, that sounds right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Perfect! I\u2019ll make sure to pass this information on to one of our attorneys who will review it and get back to you soon. They might have some additional questions or insights. Do you have any questions for me right now?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, not at the moment. I think I\u2019m good for now."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! If anything comes up or you think of questions later, feel free to reach out. Thank you for your time today, and I hope you feel better soon!"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Thanks!

Just, um, dealing with some stuff after an accident."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m really sorry to hear that. I\u2019m here to help you through this process. Can you tell me a little bit about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, so, um, it was on June 24th, I think, and I was at this, like, restaurant in Miami. I slipped on some water that was, you know, on the floor."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really painful. Was there any warning, like a sign or something, to indicate the floor was wet?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I don\u2019t think so. I mean, I didn\u2019t see one. I just went to, uh, grab some food and then\u2014boom! I just, like, fell."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Ouch! That must have been quite the fall. Did you notice if anyone else was around when it happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, there were a few people, but they didn\u2019t really, um, help much. They just kind of stared."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s tough. Did you have a chance to speak with the restaurant staff after you fell?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I did. They, um, called an ambulance, but I think they were, like, really nervous about it. They didn\u2019t want to take responsibility or something."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I can understand why that would be frustrating. Have you been to the doctor or received any medical treatment since the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I went, um, to the ER. They checked me out and said I had a concussion and some bruises. They, like, told me to rest and stuff."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m glad you got checked out, but it sounds pretty serious with a concussion. Have you been following up with any other doctors since then?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I went to my primary care doc too. He said I should, um, do physical therapy because my neck has been, like, really hurting."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really important. I\u2019m sorry to hear you\u2019ve been in pain. Have you kept track of any medical bills or expenses related to your treatment?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, yeah, I have some bills. I don\u2019t know the exact amounts, but it\u2019s, like, a lot. I\u2019ve been missing work too, so, um, that\u2019s making things harder."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I can imagine how that would add extra stress. Have you had any discussions with the restaurant\u2019s insurance or your own about this?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I think they have insurance, but, um, I didn\u2019t get the name or anything. The staff just, like, brushed it off when I asked."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s frustrating. It\u2019s good to know they have insurance, though. Did you happen to get any information from them, like a contact number or the name of the insurance company?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, um, I didn\u2019t get any of that. I was just focused on, like, dealing with the pain and stuff."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I completely understand. It\u2019s hard to think about those details when you're hurt. Do you know if you were able to take any pictures of the area where you fell?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I took a couple with my phone, but they\u2019re, like, not the best. Just, um, showing the wet floor."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s actually really helpful! Pictures can be great evidence. So, um, have you spoken to any other attorneys about this incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, you\u2019re, like, the first I\u2019ve called. I wanted to see what, um, my options were."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s totally fine. We can definitely help you figure that out. Just to clarify, have you had any other injuries or pre-existing conditions that could affect your recovery?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I\u2019ve been fine before this. I mean, just the usual stuff, but nothing serious."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it. That\u2019s good to know. So, um, just to summarize: you slipped at a restaurant in Miami on June 24th, suffered a concussion and neck pain, and you\u2019ve been to the ER and your primary care doctor. You\u2019ve taken some pictures of the scene but didn\u2019t get any insurance information from the restaurant.

How can I assist you today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Hi, Carlos. I\u2019m, um, I\u2019m calling about an accident I had with a product that I think was defective."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m really sorry to hear that. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Sure. So, um, it was on December 1st this year. I was using this electric, um, I think it was a hair straightener, and it like, um, it caught fire while I was using it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Oh wow, that sounds really scary! I can imagine that must have been quite a shock. Were you injured at all in that incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I got burned on my arm and my hand. It was pretty bad, um, I had to go to the hospital and they treated me there."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m glad you sought medical attention. That\u2019s really important. Can you tell me a bit more about your injuries? How are you feeling now?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Well, um, the burns were second-degree burns, and they, like, wrapped my arm and gave me some medication for the pain. It still hurts sometimes, and I have to go for follow-up appointments."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really painful. I appreciate you sharing that with me. So, um, do you happen to know if the hair straightener had any brand name or if it was still under warranty at the time of the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, it was a brand called \"LuxeHeat.\" I bought it online, and I think I still have the receipt. It was, like, only a few months old when it happened."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s really helpful information. Did you happen to keep the product, or do you have any photos from the incident that could show the damage?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I still have it! I took pictures of it after it caught fire. It looks pretty charred."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Perfect! Photos can be really helpful in these cases. Have you had a chance to report this incident to the manufacturer or retailer at all?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, no, I haven't done that yet. I wasn\u2019t sure if I should or what to do next, really."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s understandable. We can help guide you through that process. Now, did you happen to exchange any insurance information with the retailer or the manufacturer?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I didn't think about that. I just bought it online, so I\u2019m not sure if they have insurance or anything like that."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it. That\u2019s okay. Sometimes it can be tricky with online purchases. Have you looked into whether they have a warranty or any kind of customer service number you can contact?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I think they do have a customer service number. I can check the website again."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That would be a good idea.

Do you know if your medical expenses have been significant, or are they still ongoing?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, they\u2019re pretty significant. I mean, the hospital bills are piling up, and I\u2019ve had to take time off work because of the pain and recovery."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m really sorry to hear that. It\u2019s really tough when injuries affect your work and finances. Just to get a clearer picture, how did the fire start? Were there any specific issues with the product that you noticed?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Well, um, I think it overheated. I was using it normally, but then it just, like, started smoking and then\u2014boom!\u2014it caught fire."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really alarming. Were there any witnesses around who saw what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes! My sister was in the room with me. She freaked out and helped me put it out."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Having a witness can definitely help support your case. I appreciate you sharing that. As for the follow-up, we work on a contingency fee basis, so you won\u2019t have to pay anything upfront. We only get paid if you do."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh, that\u2019s good to know. I was worried about the costs."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Absolutely, I understand that concern.

What should I do in the meantime?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I recommend keeping all your medical records and any communication you have with the manufacturer. If you have the product and photos, keep those safe as well."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Alright, I\u2019ll do that. Thank you so much, Carlos."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "You\u2019re welcome! Thank you for reaching out, and I hope you feel better soon.

Can you tell me a little bit about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, um, so I was at this... uh, this store in Boston on June 2nd, and I like, slipped on some water on the floor. There were no signs or anything, and I fell really hard."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Oh no, I\u2019m really sorry to hear that! Falling like that can be really dangerous. Did you end up injuring yourself?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I did. I, um, I hurt my wrist and my back. I went to the hospital right after, and they said I have like, a sprain and some, um, muscle strain or something. It really hurts."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really painful. I can only imagine how tough that must be for you. Did you happen to get any documentation from the hospital about your injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I have some papers from the hospital. They gave me a prescription for pain meds and told me to go to physical therapy."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s good that you have that documentation. It\u2019ll be helpful for your case. Now, can you tell me a bit more about the incident? Were there any employees around when you fell?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, yeah, there was one person nearby, but they didn\u2019t help me right away. I, like, waited for a while before someone came over. I think they were busy stocking shelves or something."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I see. So it sounds like there wasn\u2019t any immediate assistance. Did you notice if there were any signs indicating that the floor was wet or any kind of warnings?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, there were no signs at all. I was just, um, walking, and then I slipped. It was really unexpected."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That definitely sounds like a situation where the store could be held responsible for not maintaining a safe environment. Did you report the incident to the store management right after it happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I did. I told the manager, and he seemed, like, really surprised. He said he would check the cameras and stuff."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s good to hear that you reported it. Having that acknowledgment from the management can be important. Do you happen to know if the store has insurance coverage for this kind of situation?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I think they do. The manager mentioned something about insurance, but I didn\u2019t catch the name or anything. I was still kinda shaken up, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s completely understandable. Do you remember if they exchanged any insurance information with you, or if they took any details about your injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, they didn\u2019t give me any information. I just, like, filled out a report for them and that was it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, that\u2019s helpful to know. We can try to follow up on that later. Since you mentioned you were injured and it sounds significant, have you had to take any time off work because of your injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I had to take two weeks off. I work at a cafe, and I couldn\u2019t lift anything or, like, stand for too long. I\u2019m still not back to normal, either."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s tough, especially when you rely on your physical ability to work. It sounds like this incident has really impacted your life. Have you been in contact with any other attorneys about this situation?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, no, I haven\u2019t. I wasn\u2019t sure if I needed a lawyer or not until now."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s completely fine. We\u2019re here to help you navigate this process.

That sounds better than I thought."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m glad to hear that! We want to make this as easy as possible for you. Before we wrap up, can you confirm the name of the store where the incident occurred?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, it was a, um, Home Goods store."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it. And just to recap everything: you slipped and fell due to water on the floor at the Home Goods store in Boston on June 2nd. You sustained injuries to your wrist and back, have documentation from the hospital, and took time off work. You reported the incident to the store manager, but you didn\u2019t receive any insurance information from them. Is there anything else you\u2019d like to add?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I think that\u2019s it. I just want to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen to anyone else."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Absolutely, and that\u2019s a great mindset to have. I\u2019ll pass your information along to one of our attorneys, and they\u2019ll review it and reach out to you soon.

How can I help you today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Hi, Carlos. Um, I\u2019m calling about a, like, accident I had recently."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m really sorry to hear that! Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, so it was on December 19th, um, 2023. I was at this, uh, restaurant in Arizona, and I slipped on a wet floor. There were no signs or anything warning about it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Oh no, that sounds really painful! Were you injured when you slipped?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I, um, hurt my back pretty badly. I\u2019ve been, like, having a lot of trouble moving around, and I went to the doctor, and they said it could take a while to heal."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m sorry to hear that you\u2019re dealing with such pain. It sounds like a tough situation. Have you been able to get any treatment for your back?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I\u2019ve been going to physical therapy, and I have some medication, but it\u2019s still hard, you know? I can\u2019t do a lot of things I used to."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really frustrating. I appreciate you sharing that with me. Were there any witnesses to the accident, or did you happen to speak with anyone at the restaurant afterward?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, yeah, there were a couple of people who saw me fall. I think they were customers, but, like, I didn\u2019t get their names. The staff, they just helped me up and told me to be careful."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Did you get the name of the restaurant or, um, any insurance information from them?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, the restaurant is called, um, The Green Plate. They did give me their insurance info, I think it was through, um, some company called, like, SafeGuard or something like that."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That's helpful to know. So, you did exchange insurance information with them, which is great. Do you know if they had any specific signs or warnings about the wet floor, or was it completely unmarked?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, there were no signs at all. I remember looking around after I fell, and, um, I didn\u2019t see anything. Just a lot of people eating and stuff."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That definitely raises some concerns about their liability. Have you, um, considered whether you\u2019ll need any ongoing medical treatment or help with, like, daily activities because of your injury?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I think I\u2019ll need more therapy, and I might need some help at home, um, for a while. It\u2019s just hard to get around."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I understand. It sounds like this injury is really impacting your daily life. I want to make sure we address that. Just to clarify, have you spoken to any other attorneys about this incident, or are you considering representation?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven\u2019t talked to anyone else. I just, um, started looking for help recently."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, that\u2019s good to know. We can definitely assist you. Just to recap, you were injured on December 19th at The Green Plate restaurant in Arizona after slipping on a wet floor that wasn\u2019t marked with any warning signs. You\u2019ve been getting treatment for your back injury, including physical therapy, and you\u2019ve exchanged insurance information with the restaurant\u2019s insurance company, SafeGuard. Is that correct?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, that\u2019s right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! I\u2019ll pass all this information along to one of our attorneys who will review it and reach out to you. They\u2019ll be able to give you more guidance on what steps to take next. Do you have any questions for me in the meantime?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, just, like, how do the fees work?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Good question! We work on a contingency fee basis, which means you don\u2019t pay us unless we win your case. If we do win, our fee will come out of the settlement or award amount. Does that make sense?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, that sounds good."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Perfect! Is there anything else you\u2019d like to ask about?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I think that\u2019s it for now. I appreciate your help."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Absolutely! I\u2019m glad I could assist you today. We\u2019ll be in touch soon with next steps.

How can I assist you today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Hi Alex, um, I\u2019m calling about a dog bite that happened a while ago."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m really sorry to hear that you\u2019ve been dealing with this. Can you tell me a bit more about the incident? When did it happen?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, it was on July 19, 2020. It happened in Denver, um, I was just out for a walk, you know, and this dog just came out of nowhere and bit me."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really frightening. I hope you\u2019re doing okay now. Do you remember what type of dog it was?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "It was a pit bull, I think. I\u2019m not like, super familiar with dog breeds, but it was definitely a big one."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it. And do you recall if the dog was with its owner at the time?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, the owner was, um, nearby. They seemed really shocked and said they were sorry, like, a lot."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s good to hear that the owner acknowledged it. Did you happen to exchange any information with them, like insurance details or anything?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I got their name and number, and they said they had insurance. I think it was, um, State Farm or something like that."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Have you had any medical treatment for your injuries from the bite?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I went to the hospital right after it happened. They cleaned it and gave me some stitches. I think I was, like, really lucky it wasn\u2019t worse, but it hurt a lot."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m glad to hear it wasn\u2019t worse, but that must have been quite painful. Do you know if you had to follow up with any additional appointments or treatments?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I had to go back for a follow-up to make sure it was healing okay. I, um, I think I went twice after that."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s understandable. It sounds like you\u2019ve had quite a bit of care. Have you experienced any lasting effects from the injury, like pain or limitations in movement?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Well, it still aches sometimes, especially when it\u2019s cold. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s, like, permanent damage, but it does bother me now and then."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I see. That\u2019s definitely something to consider. Have you talked to any other attorneys about this case, or are you looking for representation now?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven\u2019t spoken to anyone else yet. I just, um, started looking into it because I didn\u2019t know if I should do something about it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s perfectly fine. It\u2019s good that you\u2019re reaching out. Based on what you\u2019ve shared, it sounds like there\u2019s clear liability since the owner was present and acknowledged the incident. However, we\u2019ll need to gather more details about your damages and any coverage from the insurance company."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I guess that makes sense. I just want to make sure I\u2019m doing the right thing."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Absolutely, and it\u2019s great that you\u2019re being proactive. Just to clarify, have you had any discussions with the dog owner about compensation or any kind of settlement?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Not really. I was kind of in shock, and I didn\u2019t think about that at the time. I just wanted to make sure I was okay."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s understandable. It\u2019s a lot to process in the moment. We can definitely help you navigate the next steps. I\u2019ll pass this information along to one of our attorneys who will review it and get back to you."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "That sounds good. What happens next?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Once I submit your details, the attorney will review everything and reach out to you. They might have some additional questions and will help you understand your options moving forward."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Okay, great! And, um, what about fees? How does that work?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "We work on a contingency fee basis, which means you won\u2019t owe us anything unless we recover compensation for you. If we do, our fee will come out of that settlement."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Alright, that makes sense."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Perfect! Just to summarize, you were bitten by a pit bull on July 19, 2020, in Denver. The owner was present and acknowledged the incident, and you received medical treatment with some ongoing discomfort. You haven\u2019t spoken to any other attorneys yet, and you got the owner\u2019s insurance info but haven\u2019t discussed compensation. Is there anything else you\u2019d like to add or ask before we wrap up?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I think that covers it. Thank you for your help!"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "You\u2019re welcome! I\u2019ll make sure to get this information to our attorney right away. They\u2019ll reach out to you soon.

How can I help you today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, hi! I was in a car accident, um, a while ago, and I, like, I don\u2019t know what to do now."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m sorry to hear that. It can be really stressful after an accident. Can you tell me when it happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, it was, um, on February... um, 10th, I think? In 2021, yeah."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it, February 10th, 2021. And where did the accident take place?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "In Boston, I think? Or was it... um, somewhere else? No, yeah, it was Boston."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, Boston. That helps! Can you describe what happened during the accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "So, I was, um, driving, and then this other car just, like, came out of nowhere and hit me, um, on the side, I think? Yeah, the side."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really scary! Were you stopped at a light, or were you moving when the other car hit you?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I was moving, um, I think I was turning left. But, um, I don\u2019t remember all the details, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I understand\u2014it can be hard to remember everything right after an accident. Was there any police report filed?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, yeah, I think so? But, like, I didn\u2019t get a copy of it. It was, um, not a big accident, so they didn\u2019t really seem to care too much."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That makes sense. Sometimes, police don\u2019t put a lot of detail into minor accidents. Did you exchange insurance information with the other driver?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, yeah! I got their info, but, um, I can\u2019t remember the name of their insurance company. Something like, um, Allstate? Or maybe it was State Farm... I\u2019m not sure."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "No worries, it happens! Just to clarify, did you happen to catch the other driver\u2019s name?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh, um, no, I don\u2019t remember that. I was, like, kinda freaked out, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Totally understandable. Now, can you tell me about any injuries you may have sustained from the accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, I think I, like, hurt my neck a little. It was, um, sore for a while, but I'm not, like, sure if it\u2019s serious or not."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I see. And have you been to a doctor for your neck pain, or did you just kinda let it go?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I went to urgent care, I think. They, like, checked it out and gave me some, um, pain meds? But, like, I didn't go back for follow-up."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it. It sounds like you were trying to manage the pain on your own. So, just to confirm, you haven\u2019t hired another attorney for this case, right?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, no. Just, like, thought I\u2019d figure it out myself first, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I understand, and that\u2019s completely fine. Now, can you tell me about the damage to your vehicle? Was there any significant damage?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, not really? Like, maybe a dent? It was, like, a small bump, so I didn\u2019t think it was a big deal."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, that\u2019s helpful to know. It sounds like the damage wasn\u2019t too extensive. Now, since you mentioned the accident was in 2021, have you taken any steps since then regarding this incident, like filing a claim or anything?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I think I called my insurance, but I don\u2019t remember what they said. It was, like, so long ago, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Sure, it can be tough to keep track of everything. And, um, did your insurance company inform you about the other driver\u2019s coverage or anything like that?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, they might have. But I, like, didn\u2019t really keep track of that either."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "No problem at all. It\u2019s a lot to handle. Now, just to summarize what we\u2019ve talked about, you were in a car accident on February 10th, 2021, in Boston. The other driver hit your car while you were turning left. You exchanged insurance information, but you\u2019re unsure about the other driver\u2019s coverage. You experienced some neck pain after the accident and went to urgent care, but you haven\u2019t seen a doctor since. You haven\u2019t hired another attorney, and the damage to your vehicle was minimal, just a dent."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, that sounds right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! I\u2019ll pass this information along to one of our attorneys who will review it and get back to you. Just to let you know, we work on a contingency fee basis, which means you don\u2019t pay us unless we win your case."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh, that\u2019s good to know."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Absolutely!

I'm here to help with that. Can you tell me a little more about the incident? When did it happen?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, it was on December 4th, 2020. I was in Boston when it happened."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it, December 4th, 2020, in Boston. What product are we talking about here?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "It was a kitchen appliance, a blender. I was using it, and it, like, just exploded while I was blending."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Oh no, that sounds really scary! I'm sorry you went through that. Were you injured in the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, yeah, I got some cuts on my hands and a few on my face from the glass. It wasn\u2019t super serious, but it hurt a lot at the time."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I can imagine! It must have been quite shocking. Did you seek any medical treatment for your injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I didn\u2019t go to the hospital or anything. I just cleaned it up at home. I, um, didn\u2019t think it was that bad."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That makes sense. Sometimes, in the moment, we think it\u2019s not too serious. Did the blender have any labels or warnings that you think might have contributed to the accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, there was a warning about not overfilling it, but I didn\u2019t think I had. I followed the instructions."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s important to know. It sounds like there may have been a defect if it was working improperly. Did you happen to keep the receipt or any packaging for the blender?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I think I still have the receipt somewhere, but I tossed the packaging. I bought it from a store in Boston, though."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! That receipt could help establish when and where you purchased it. Did you report the incident to the store or the manufacturer?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I didn\u2019t report it to them. I was just so shocked and, I guess, frustrated. I didn't think it would matter."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s understandable. Sometimes we just react to the situation as it unfolds. Have you had a chance to look into whether the manufacturer has had any recalls or issues with that specific blender model?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I, um, did a quick search after it happened. There were some complaints, but I don\u2019t know if it was officially recalled or anything."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s good to know. It\u2019s definitely worth investigating further. Now, did you exchange any information with the manufacturer or store regarding their insurance or coverage for this situation?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I didn\u2019t, no. I didn\u2019t think about that at the time."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "No worries. It\u2019s common to overlook those details in the moment. Just to clarify, have you spoken with any other attorney about this incident already?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven\u2019t. You\u2019re the first people I\u2019m reaching out to."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thank you for trusting us with your case. I appreciate that. Given the clear liability here with the product defect, it sounds like there may be a solid case to explore."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I hope so. I just want to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen to anyone else."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s a great perspective. We definitely want to hold companies accountable for their products. Before we wrap up, can you tell me if you\u2019ve experienced any ongoing issues or problems related to your injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Not really. The cuts healed up fine, but I still get nervous when I use blenders now."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s completely understandable. It can be tough to shake off those kinds of experiences. Just to summarize what we\u2019ve talked about: you had an incident with a defective blender on December 4, 2020, in Boston, resulting in minor injuries. You haven\u2019t spoken with any other attorneys, and you didn\u2019t report the incident to the store or manufacturer."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, that sounds right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Perfect!

I was stopped at a red light when another car hit me from behind."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really stressful. Were you injured in the accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I had some neck pain and a bit of back pain. It\u2019s been bothering me since then."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I can imagine how frustrating that must be. Did you seek any medical attention after the accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I went to urgent care right after. They did some X-rays and told me to follow up with my doctor if it didn\u2019t get better."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s good that you got checked out. Have you had any follow-up appointments since then?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I went to my primary care physician a couple of times. They said I might have some whiplash and gave me a prescription for pain medication."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I see. It\u2019s good that you\u2019re taking care of your health. Can you tell me more about the other driver? Did you exchange insurance information?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I got their insurance details. They have State Farm. But I don\u2019t really remember much about their policy."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s okay! It\u2019s good that you have the insurance company.

The other driver said it was an accident, but I don\u2019t think they specifically said they were at fault."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s understandable. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to know right away. Did the police come to the scene and make a report?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, they did.

I just haven\u2019t done that yet."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s definitely something we can help you with later. Now, you mentioned you had some pre-existing injuries.

It sounds like this has affected you quite a bit. Have you kept track of any medical bills or other expenses related to your injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I have some bills from the urgent care visit and the follow-ups. I\u2019ve been keeping everything organized."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s great to hear. Keeping records can really help down the line. Have you already spoken to any other attorneys about this case?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, you\u2019re the first law firm I\u2019m contacting."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thank you for considering us! Just so you know, we work on a contingency fee basis, which means you don\u2019t pay anything unless we win your case. Does that sound good to you?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, that makes sense."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Perfect! Now, just to summarize what we\u2019ve talked about: You were in a car accident on January 15th in Denver, where you were hit from behind at a red light. You experienced neck and back pain, sought medical attention, and have had some follow-ups. You have the other driver\u2019s insurance through State Farm, and the police did come to the scene. You also mentioned some pre-existing back issues, but you were managing them before the accident."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "That sounds about right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! The next steps will be for one of our attorneys to review the information you've provided and get back to you. They may also want to discuss the police report and any further details. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I think you covered everything.

My name is Alex, and I'm here to help you today. How can I assist you?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Hi, um, yeah, I was calling about an accident that happened a while back, um, like, almost three years ago now?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Absolutely, I can help with that. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Right, so it was, um, on September 30th, 2020. I was at this, like, park in Chicago with some friends. We were just hanging out, and, um, I tripped over a broken sidewalk and fell really hard."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Oh no, that sounds painful! I\u2019m really sorry to hear that. When you fell, did you notice if there were any signs or warnings about the broken sidewalk?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, no, not really. I mean, I guess it was just, like, a regular park. There wasn\u2019t anything saying to be careful or anything. It was pretty bad, though."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I can imagine! Was anyone else around when this happened? Did anyone see you fall?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, my friends were there, and there were some people walking their dogs and stuff. They helped me up after I fell."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That's good to hear that you had some people around you. Were you hurt pretty badly?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I mean, I ended up with a sprained wrist and, like, a really nasty bruise on my leg. I had to go to the hospital, and they were like, \u201cYou gotta rest and stuff.\u201d"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really tough. Did you require any further medical treatment after that initial visit?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, yeah, I had to go for physical therapy for, like, a couple of months. It was, um, pretty painful, and I missed out on some school and stuff."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I can understand how that would\u2019ve impacted your school life. Did you end up getting any documentation from your doctor or physical therapist regarding your injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I think so? I have some papers from the hospital, and I might have the therapy stuff too. I should be able to find it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Perfect! That\u2019ll be really helpful. Now, when the accident happened, did you happen to exchange any information with the park or the city, like, if they had insurance or anything like that?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I... I don\u2019t think I did. I was kinda focusing on my wrist and everything. But, like, I heard my friends say something about the park having insurance, but I don\u2019t know the details or anything."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s okay! It can be overwhelming in the moment. Do you remember if you reported the incident to anyone at the park or the city afterwards?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I think my friend talked to someone at the park, but I, like, didn\u2019t really pay attention. I was just worried about my arm."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That makes sense. It\u2019s tough to think of everything when you\u2019re in pain. Was there any follow-up from the park or anyone after the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Not really. I didn\u2019t hear anything from them after that initial talk. I think they just, like, brushed it off or something."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Alright, thanks for sharing that. I know it can be hard to recall everything. Since this happened a while ago, have you spoken to any other attorneys about your case?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven\u2019t. I was just trying to figure things out on my own, and then I thought I should maybe get some help."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s completely understandable. And just to clarify, were there any other injuries or damages related to this incident that we haven\u2019t discussed yet?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, just the injuries I mentioned. But, like, I had to miss a couple of weeks of school, so I guess that affected my grades a bit."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it. That can be really frustrating, especially when you\u2019re trying to keep up with school. So, just to summarize everything we talked about: You tripped over a broken sidewalk at a park in Chicago on September 30, 2020, resulting in a sprained wrist and bruising on your leg. You received medical treatment and went to physical therapy, and you might have some documentation for that. You didn\u2019t exchange insurance info with the park, but you heard they might have coverage. You haven\u2019t spoken to any other attorneys yet."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, that sounds right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! Thank you for sharing all that with me. I\u2019ll pass this information along to one of our attorneys, who will review it and get back to you. They\u2019ll be able to discuss your options moving forward. Do you have any questions for me about the process or anything else?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, not really. Just, like, how do the fees work?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Good question! We work on a contingency fee basis, which means that we only get paid if we win your case. So, you won\u2019t have to worry about upfront legal fees."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh, okay, that\u2019s good to know."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Absolutely! If anything else comes to mind, feel free to reach out. Otherwise, you should hear back from us soon. Thanks again for calling, and take care!"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Thank you!

I hope he\u2019s doing okay. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, it was on July 20th. We were in Austin, Texas. He was using this toy that, uh, I think was defective. It broke while he was playing, and he got hurt pretty badly."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really concerning. I\u2019m glad he\u2019s okay enough to talk about it. Can you describe the toy and what exactly happened when it broke?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Sure. It was a, um, a remote-controlled car. He was just playing with it in the backyard when the wheel just, like, popped off, and he fell and hit his arm on the concrete."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Ouch! That must have been painful for him. Did he have to go to the hospital or see a doctor afterward?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, we went to the ER. They said he had a fracture in his arm and some scrapes. He\u2019s in a cast now and, um, it\u2019s been tough on him."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I can only imagine how hard that must be for both of you. Has he had any follow-up appointments since then?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, we\u2019ve had a couple of follow-ups. The doctor said it\u2019ll take a few weeks to heal, and, um, he\u2019s going to need physical therapy too."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "It sounds like a lot for a kid to handle. I\u2019m sorry he\u2019s having to go through this. Now, could you tell me where you purchased the toy?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "We got it from, um, a local toy store here in Austin. It was a popular brand."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it. Did you happen to keep the packaging or any information about the brand or model of the toy?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I still have the box. It has all the details on it. I can provide that if needed."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s great to hear. That\u2019ll really help with the case. Now, did you happen to exchange any information with the store or the manufacturer about the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, um, we didn\u2019t really know what to do at the time. I mean, we were just focused on getting him help."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Understandable. It\u2019s a lot to deal with in such a stressful situation. Did you notice if the toy had any warnings or instructions that might relate to its use?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "There were some instructions, but I don\u2019t remember if there were any warnings. It seemed pretty safe at first."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, that\u2019s useful to know. Now, have you talked to any other attorneys about this situation?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, not yet. I wanted to see what my options are first."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That makes sense. We can help guide you through your options. Now, regarding the insurance aspect, do you know if the toy store or the manufacturer has insurance for incidents like this?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I\u2019m not sure. I didn\u2019t get any insurance info, but I can check with the store if that helps."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Absolutely, that would be helpful. It\u2019s important to know what coverage they might have. Now, could you tell me about your son\u2019s injuries a bit more? Aside from the fracture and scrapes, how has this affected him?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Well, he\u2019s been in a lot of pain, and he can\u2019t do a lot of the things he used to enjoy, like riding his bike or playing with his friends. It\u2019s been really hard on him emotionally too."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s completely understandable. It\u2019s tough for kids to have their activities limited like that. I\u2019m really sorry he\u2019s going through this. Have you had any medical expenses, or do you anticipate any more costs for his treatment?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, we\u2019ve already had some bills from the ER and the doctor\u2019s visits. I\u2019m worried about the physical therapy costs too."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s a valid concern. We usually work on a contingency fee basis, so we would only get paid if you win your case. Does that sound okay to you?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, that makes sense. I don\u2019t want to pay anything upfront if I can avoid it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Absolutely. I\u2019ll make a note of that. So, just to summarize what we\u2019ve talked about: your son had an accident on July 20th while playing with a remote-controlled car that you believe may have been defective. He suffered a fracture and scrapes, and he\u2019s currently in a cast. You\u2019re concerned about the medical expenses and the emotional impact this has had on him. You haven\u2019t spoken to any other attorneys yet, and you\u2019re willing to gather more information from the store about their insurance."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, that\u2019s right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! I\u2019ll pass all of this information to one of our attorneys who will review it and get back to you.

How can I assist you today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Hi, um, I was hoping to get some help regarding a dog bite incident I had."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Of course, I\u2019m really sorry to hear that you went through that. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, it was on September 5th, just a few weeks ago. I was at a friend's house in Arizona, and their neighbor's dog came running out of the yard. It just, uh, attacked me out of nowhere."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really frightening. I hope you\u2019re doing okay now. Can you tell me what kind of injuries you sustained from the bite?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Well, I had a few puncture wounds on my arm. They were pretty deep, and I had to go to the urgent care to get them cleaned and bandaged. They gave me a tetanus shot and some antibiotics."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m glad you sought medical attention. That\u2019s really important. Did you have to miss work or anything because of the injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I ended up missing about a week. I work in retail, so it was hard not being there. I also had to go back for a follow-up appointment a few days later."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s tough, especially when you\u2019re dealing with the pain and stress of an injury. I appreciate you sharing that with me. Now, can you tell me a little more about the dog? Do you know if it had any history of aggression or had bitten someone before?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I\u2019m not really sure about the dog\u2019s history, but, um, it seemed to be a friendly dog when I saw it before. I didn't expect it to act that way. The owner did apologize afterward and said they\u2019d pay for my medical bills, but I haven\u2019t gotten anything in writing yet."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "It\u2019s good that the owner acknowledged the incident. Have you exchanged any insurance information with them? Like, do you know if they have homeowner\u2019s or renter\u2019s insurance?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, they said they have renter\u2019s insurance. I got the name of the insurance company, but I didn\u2019t, um, write down the policy number or anything."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s okay! Just having the insurance company\u2019s name can be a good start. How about any other witnesses? Were there any other people around who saw what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, my friend was there, and so was their roommate. They both saw it happen and were really shocked. I think they\u2019d be willing to give statements if needed."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s really helpful! Witnesses can make a big difference in these cases. Now, I know you mentioned the owner promised to pay for your medical bills, but have you received any sort of written documentation or had any further discussions with them about the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, not yet. I was waiting to see how my injuries healed before I contacted them again. I guess I was just hoping it would all work itself out, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I completely understand that. It can be overwhelming to deal with everything at once. So, just to make sure I have everything clear: you were bitten by your friend\u2019s neighbor\u2019s dog, you sustained puncture wounds and missed a week of work, and you have the insurance company's name but no policy number. Is that correct?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, that\u2019s right. I feel like I may need help in figuring this out."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Absolutely, it\u2019s perfectly okay to seek assistance.

I\u2019d be happy to help you with that. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Sure. So, it was April 3rd, 2022, and I was at this apartment complex in Phoenix. I was visiting a friend, and I slipped on some wet stairs."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Oh no, that sounds really painful. Was the area marked with any signs, or do you think it was just, like, a maintenance issue?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, there weren't any signs or anything. I think they just hadn\u2019t cleaned up the water. I told my friend about it, and she said it happens all the time."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Wow, that\u2019s definitely concerning. Were there any witnesses to the incident, like other people around who saw what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, there were a couple of people, but I didn\u2019t get their names or anything. Just my friend who was with me."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I see. And how did you feel immediately after the fall? Did you notice any injuries right away?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "My wrist hurt a lot, and I twisted my ankle too. It was, um, pretty bad. I ended up going to the ER later that day."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really tough. Did they give you any specific diagnoses or treatment for your injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "They said I had a sprained wrist and, like, some swelling in my ankle. They put a brace on my wrist and gave me crutches for a bit."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it. Thanks for sharing that. Have you had any follow-up treatments since then, like physical therapy or anything else?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I did a few sessions of physical therapy for my ankle. The wrist healed up okay, but the ankle still bothers me sometimes, especially when I walk for long periods."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m sorry to hear that. It must be frustrating not to be fully recovered yet. Now, regarding where the incident happened, did you happen to exchange any information with the property owner or the management?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Not really. I didn\u2019t think to ask them for their insurance info at the time. I just focused on getting help for my injuries."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That makes sense. It's understandable in a situation like that. Did you happen to find out if the apartment complex has any liability insurance?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I\u2019m not sure. I think my friend might know, but I didn\u2019t ask her about it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, no problem. I can see how it can be a bit overwhelming. I\u2019d like to understand more about your experience. Have you spoken with any other attorneys about this incident yet?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven\u2019t.

And then this big dog ran up to us, and, um, it just... it bit my leg."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really painful. I hope you\u2019re doing okay now. Was the dog on a leash or was it running loose?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "It was loose. I mean, there was no owner in sight at first. Then, um, I saw a guy come over, and he said it was his dog. He didn\u2019t seem too concerned, though."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Wow, that must have been alarming. Did you get the owner\u2019s information or any details about the dog, like its breed or anything?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I got his name\u2014um, it was Mark, I think. And the dog was a, um, a German Shepherd. I didn\u2019t actually get any insurance info right away because I was, you know, kind of in shock."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s completely understandable. It\u2019s a lot to process in the moment. Did you manage to exchange any contact information, like a phone number or an address?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I got his number. He said he\u2019d pay for any medical bills, but I didn\u2019t really believe him at the time, you know? I just wanted to get to the hospital."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That makes sense. Your health is the priority. Speaking of which, what kind of injuries did you sustain from the bite?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, it was pretty bad. I had to get stitches on my leg, and there was a lot of swelling. They said I might have some nerve damage too. I\u2019ve been in physical therapy since then."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really serious. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re getting the treatment you need. Have you had any other medical evaluations since then, or is it just the physical therapy?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I had a follow-up with my doctor, and they said I might need more treatment if the pain doesn\u2019t go away. It\u2019s been really frustrating."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I can only imagine how tough that must be for you. Have you kept records of all your medical visits and treatments related to this incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I have all the documents. My physical therapist gave me a bunch of papers, and I also have the hospital bills."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great, that\u2019ll be really helpful. Now, about the insurance\u2014did you ever get the dog owner\u2019s insurance information, or did he mention what kind of coverage he had?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, he didn\u2019t mention anything about insurance. I was just focused on getting help for my leg. I thought he would contact me later, but...

So, just to clarify, you haven\u2019t spoken to him since the day of the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Right, no contact at all. I tried calling him a couple of times, but he didn\u2019t answer."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m really sorry to hear that. It\u2019s important that you get the support you need for your medical bills. Have you had a chance to speak with any other attorneys about this situation?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven\u2019t. I didn\u2019t really know where to start, so I thought I\u2019d just call you guys first."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m glad you reached out to us. I\u2019ll make sure to pass all this information to one of our attorneys. They\u2019ll review it and get back to you. Just to recap, you were bitten by a loose dog in Phoenix on May 17th, you received stitches and are undergoing physical therapy, and you haven\u2019t been able to contact the dog owner since the incident, right?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, that\u2019s all correct."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Perfect. And we operate on a contingency fee basis, so you won\u2019t have to pay anything unless we win your case.

How can I assist you today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Hi, uh, this is, um, Jamie.

I\u2019d be happy to help you with that. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, so, um, I was over at my friend\u2019s house on June 21st, and I kinda slipped on some steps that were, like, really slick. There was, um, no mat or anything there, and I fell down."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really painful! I hope you\u2019re okay. Can you tell me if you were injured in the fall?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I, um, hurt my ankle pretty badly. It was swollen for a while, and I couldn\u2019t walk on it for a few days. I went to the doctor, and they said it was a sprain."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m sorry to hear that you had to go through that. It can be really tough to deal with injuries. Did you happen to get any medical treatment for your ankle?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I went to urgent care right after the fall. They gave me some pain meds and told me to rest it, um, for a week or so."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s good that you sought medical attention. It\u2019s important to have documentation. Were there any other injuries or damages that you experienced from this incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, no, just the ankle, but I missed a few days of work, too. I\u2019m not sure how that will, um, affect my paycheck."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I understand. Missing work can definitely add to the stress of an injury. Can I ask, do you know if your friend has homeowner's or renter's insurance that might cover this situation?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I think they have renter\u2019s insurance. They mentioned it once, but I didn\u2019t, like, get the details."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s helpful information! Did you and your friend exchange any insurance information at the time of the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, not really. I just, um, told them about the fall, and they were worried, but we didn\u2019t talk about insurance or anything."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I see. It\u2019s understandable that insurance wasn\u2019t the first thing on your mind after getting hurt. Did you take any photos of the area where you fell, or is there any evidence that shows how slippery the steps were?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I didn\u2019t think to take photos at the time, but I, like, told a couple of friends who were there. They might remember how bad it was."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That could be helpful, especially if they can confirm what it was like. Have you spoken to anyone else about your situation, or do you have another attorney representing you?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven\u2019t talked to anyone else yet. This is, like, my first call about it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, that\u2019s good to know. I want to make sure we help you from this point forward. So, just to recap, you slipped on some steps at your friend\u2019s place in Seattle on June 21st, you injured your ankle, and you sought medical treatment. Your friend has renter\u2019s insurance, but you haven\u2019t exchanged any insurance details yet. Also, you missed work due to this injury. Did I get everything right?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, that sounds right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! What will happen next is that I\u2019ll pass this information along to one of our attorneys who will review it and get back to you. They might have some follow-up questions. Do you have any questions for me about the process or anything else?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, yeah, how does this all work? Like, do I have to pay anything upfront?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Good question! We work on a contingency fee basis, which means you won\u2019t have to pay anything upfront. We only get paid if you win the case, so it takes a lot of the stress off you."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "That sounds good.

How can I help you today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, hi, Carlos. I, uh, wanted to talk about an accident I had, um, a while ago. I think it was in March of 2021."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Of course! I'm here to listen. So, can you tell me what happened during that incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, so, I was, um, using this blender I bought online, and it, like, just stopped working while I was blending some stuff, and then it, uh, started smoking."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Oh no, that sounds really alarming! Did you have any injuries from that?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Not really injuries, but I, um, kind of panicked and spilled hot soup everywhere. It was a mess!"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I can imagine! That must've been frustrating. Was there any damage to your property, like your kitchen or anything else?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I mean, the soup got everywhere, but, um, I don\u2019t think there was, like, any permanent damage. Just had to clean it up."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it. It sounds like the main issue was the blender itself. Did you happen to reach out to the manufacturer or the store where you bought it?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I did! I, um, contacted the company, and they said I could send it back for, like, an inspection or something. But, um, they didn't really offer any help beyond that."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s frustrating. Did you get any documentation from them about the blender's malfunction or their response?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I think I have some emails from them. I can check, but, uh, I don\u2019t remember if they said anything specific about the issue."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s okay! Having those emails can be helpful. Just to clarify, do you still have the blender, or did you send it back to them?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh, I sent it back already. They wanted it for, um, inspection. So, I don\u2019t have it anymore."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Understood. And do you happen to know if they have insurance or, like, any liability coverage for situations like this?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I think they mentioned something about having insurance when I contacted them, but I didn\u2019t really ask for details about it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s alright! It\u2019s good that they acknowledged having insurance. Now, just to circle back a bit, do you have any specific injuries or damages you\u2019re looking to pursue in this case?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, just, like, the hassle of it all, you know? I just felt, um, really uneasy using the product after that."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I totally understand. It\u2019s completely reasonable to feel that way after an experience like that. Just to confirm, do you have any other attorneys representing you for this issue?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven\u2019t talked to anyone else about it. You\u2019re the first call I\u2019m making."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! That makes things a little easier. Um, since you mentioned the incident was in Phoenix, is that where the company is based, or, like, where you bought the blender?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I bought it online, so I\u2019m not sure where they\u2019re based. But I think they\u2019re in, um, California or something."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, that\u2019s helpful to know. So to summarize, you had an incident with a blender that malfunctioned, causing you to spill hot soup but no injuries. You contacted the manufacturer, sent the blender back for inspection, and you\u2019re unsure of their insurance details. You don\u2019t currently have an attorney representing you, and the incident happened in Phoenix. Is there anything else you think might be important for me to know?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I think that covers it. Oh, wait! I did post about it on social media, but I wasn\u2019t, like, trying to complain or anything. Just, um, sharing my experience."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s totally understandable. Sharing experiences can be helpful! Just keep in mind that if you decide to pursue this further, it\u2019s best to avoid discussing it publicly for now."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh, right! I didn\u2019t think about that."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "No worries! I\u2019ll make sure to pass all this information along to one of our attorneys for review. They\u2019ll get back to you to discuss your options. Does that sound good?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, that sounds good. Thanks, Carlos."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "You\u2019re welcome! I appreciate you sharing your experience with me today.

Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Sure, um, it was on February 20th this year, 2025, I think. I was using this blender that I bought online, and, uh, it just kind of... exploded while I was blending something."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Oh no, that sounds really dangerous! Were you injured at all during the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I, um, got some cuts on my hands and, like, a bruise on my arm from the glass shattering. It hurt pretty bad, but I didn\u2019t go to the hospital. I just, like, cleaned it up at home."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I understand. It\u2019s good you were able to take care of it, but I can imagine that it must have been quite alarming. Did you happen to take any pictures of your injuries or the blender itself after the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, yeah! I took some pictures of the blender, um, before I threw it out. I didn\u2019t think to take pictures of my hands, though."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s okay; having the photos of the blender is still helpful. Can you tell me what brand it was and where you purchased it?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "It was, uh, a... BlendMaster, I think? I ordered it from, um, like, an online store, Amazon or something."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great, BlendMaster. And did you happen to check if they have a warranty or any return policy for defective products?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I think they do, but I didn\u2019t really look into it much after the accident. I just wanted to get rid of it, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Yeah, that makes sense. Sometimes it can be overwhelming after an incident like that. Did you reach out to the company at all to report what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, not really. I thought about it, but I wasn\u2019t sure if it would do any good."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I understand. It can be tough to know what to do next. When you were using the blender, were there any specific instructions or warnings that you noticed in the manual or on the product itself?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, I don\u2019t remember seeing any warnings about it exploding or anything. Just the usual\u2014don\u2019t submerge it in water or whatever."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, that\u2019s helpful to know. So, about your injuries\u2014aside from the cuts and bruise, have you experienced any other issues since the incident, like pain or discomfort?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Not really. Just, like, a little soreness, but nothing serious."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s good to hear. Now, have you had any other representation for this case, or is this the first time you\u2019re reaching out for help?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven\u2019t talked to anyone else about it.

Just the blender was, like, destroyed."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it. So, just to summarize, you were using a BlendMaster blender that exploded on February 20th, resulting in cuts on your hands and a bruise on your arm. You didn\u2019t go to the hospital and didn\u2019t have any other property damage aside from the blender itself.

Can you tell me a little more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, it was on January 20th. I was driving in Denver when, um, another car ran a red light and hit me."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Oh no, that sounds really scary! I hope you\u2019re okay. Were there any injuries as a result of the accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I got hurt pretty badly. I had some significant injuries\u2014like, my shoulder is messed up, and I also had some whiplash."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m really sorry to hear that. It sounds painful. Did you receive any medical treatment right away, or was there a delay?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Well, I didn\u2019t go to the hospital immediately. I thought it was just a little sore, but then, like, a few days later, I couldn\u2019t move my shoulder properly and had to go get it checked out."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That makes sense. It\u2019s not uncommon to feel the effects a bit later. Did you end up getting any specific diagnoses or treatments from a doctor?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, they said I had a rotator cuff injury and some severe neck strain. I\u2019ve been doing physical therapy since then, but it\u2019s been tough, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really frustrating. Physical therapy can take time. Have you been able to keep up with your sessions?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I\u2019m trying my best. I go twice a week, but it\u2019s really affecting my job because, um, I'm a mechanic, and I can\u2019t lift heavy stuff like I used to."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That must be really challenging, especially since you rely on that physically demanding work. Have you missed any work because of your injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I\u2019ve missed quite a bit. I, um, I missed about three weeks right after the accident and then a few days here and there for appointments."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I can imagine that\u2019s been tough on you both physically and financially. I wanted to ask, who was at fault in the accident? Did you have a chance to exchange insurance information with the other driver?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, it was definitely their fault. They ran the red light. We exchanged insurance info, and their insurance is with, um, Statewide Insurance, I think."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great, that\u2019s helpful to know. Have you had any conversations with their insurance about your claim?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Not really. I\u2019ve been focusing on my recovery, and I wasn\u2019t sure how to approach them about it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s understandable.

I\u2019m really sorry to hear that. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Sure, it was on April 15th, 2021. I was just walking in my neighborhood in Denver when a dog came charging out of its yard and bit me on the leg."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really painful! I hope you\u2019re doing okay now. Was the dog on a leash, or was it just running free?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "It was running free. The owner was actually standing outside, and they didn\u2019t do anything to stop it. I think they were just surprised."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s definitely concerning. Did you get a chance to talk to the owner after the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I did. They apologized and told me that the dog had never bitten anyone before. They were really nice about it, but I don\u2019t know if that really changes anything."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "It\u2019s good that they were understanding, but it doesn\u2019t really take away from what you experienced. Did you happen to exchange any insurance information with the owner?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I asked for it, and they gave me their homeowner\u2019s insurance details. I think it was with Progressive, but I\u2019m not completely sure."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s helpful to know. So, just to clarify, the dog was off-leash, and the owner was present when it happened. Did you seek any medical attention for your injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I went to the hospital right after it happened. They treated my leg, but it was just a minor bite. I didn't need stitches or anything, but they gave me a tetanus shot."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I'm glad to hear it wasn't more serious, though it must have been really distressing. Have you experienced any ongoing issues from the bite, like pain or infection?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Not really. I mean, it hurt for a while, but there\u2019s no lasting damage or anything. Just a bruise now."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s a relief! Since you mentioned the dog had bitten you, do you know if the owner has any prior incidents with this dog or any other complaints?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I\u2019m not sure. They said it was the first time, but I didn\u2019t really press them on it. I guess I was just more focused on my leg at the time."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That makes sense. It can be hard to think clearly in such situations. Have you already spoken to any other attorneys about this incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven\u2019t. I wasn't sure if I needed a lawyer since it was just a minor injury."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s totally understandable.

How can I assist you today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Hi, um, I\u2019m calling about a dog bite incident that happened on October 30th."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Oh no, I\u2019m really sorry to hear that! That must have been quite distressing. Can you tell me a little more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, so I was just walking in my neighborhood in Seattle, and this dog, um, came running out of a yard. I didn\u2019t see it coming, and it bit me on the leg."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really scary! Was the dog on a leash at the time, or was it running loose?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "It was loose. I don\u2019t think the owner was even around when it happened. The dog just, like, came out of nowhere."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it. So, you mentioned it bit your leg. Can you tell me more about the injuries you sustained? Did you need any medical treatment?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I had to go to the hospital because it was a pretty deep bite. They cleaned it out and gave me some stitches. I\u2019ve been having some pain and, um, it's been hard to walk sometimes."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Ouch, that sounds painful! I hope you\u2019re feeling a bit better now. Have you followed up with any doctors since the initial treatment?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I went to my primary care doctor a week later. They said it was healing okay, but they\u2019re worried about infections and stuff."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s understandable. It\u2019s good that you\u2019re following up with your doctor. Now, regarding the dog, do you know if the owner has any insurance or if you were able to get their information?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I, um, didn\u2019t get the owner\u2019s info at the time. I was just really shaken up. But I did talk to a neighbor later, and they said the owner has a renter\u2019s insurance policy."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s helpful to know. It\u2019s good that you were able to get some information. Do you know the name of the insurance company or anything like that?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I think it\u2019s, um, Evergreen Insurance or something like that. I\u2019m not completely sure, I might have to check back with the neighbor."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s okay, it\u2019s a good start! We can figure that out later if needed. Now, just to clarify, do you have any other representation for this case, or have you spoken to any other attorneys?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven\u2019t spoken to anyone else. I just found your number online and thought I\u2019d reach out."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great, thank you for letting me know. Now, can I ask if you have any past medical history that we should be aware of? It might help us understand your situation better."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I had some knee issues before this, but I didn\u2019t have any major surgeries or anything. Just some physical therapy a few years ago."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s helpful to know. It sounds like you were managing okay before this incident. Now, with the injuries you\u2019ve mentioned, can you estimate how this has affected you day-to-day?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Well, I\u2019ve had to take time off work because I can\u2019t walk properly, and, um, I\u2019ve been in a lot of pain, so it\u2019s been tough."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m really sorry to hear that. It sounds like this has impacted your life more than just physically. Have you been able to keep track of any medical bills or costs related to your treatment?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I\u2019ve got some bills from the hospital and my doctor\u2019s visits. It\u2019s adding up, and I\u2019m worried about how I\u2019m going to pay for everything."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s completely understandable. We typically work on a contingency fee basis, which means we only get paid if you win your case. So, you wouldn\u2019t have to worry about upfront costs."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh, okay, that sounds better. I was worried about paying out of pocket."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m glad I could clarify that for you. So, just to recap: You were bitten by a loose dog while walking in Seattle on October 30th, you received medical treatment at the hospital and followed up with your primary care doctor, and you\u2019ve encountered some financial stress from medical bills. You mentioned the dog\u2019s owner might have renter\u2019s insurance, but you\u2019ll need to confirm the details. Is that correct?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, that\u2019s all right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Perfect! I\u2019ll pass this information along to one of our attorneys who will review it and get back to you soon. They\u2019ll be able to provide more guidance on what steps to take next. Is there anything else you\u2019d like to ask me while we\u2019re on the phone?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, no, I think that covers it. Thank you for listening!"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Absolutely! I\u2019m here to help. You\u2019ll hear from us soon, and take care of yourself in the meantime. Have a good day!"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Thanks, you too!"}], "outcome_status": "dropped", "outcome_value": 0}

How can I help you today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Hi, um, I\u2019m calling about an incident that happened back in January."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Of course! I'm here to listen. Can you tell me what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, so, um, I was at this bar in Chicago, right? It was, like, really crowded, and I slipped on some spilled drink on the floor."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Oh no, that sounds really painful! I'm sorry to hear that. When exactly did this happen?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "It was, um, January 31st."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it. And can you tell me a bit more about the bar? Was it a chain or a local place?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "It's a local bar, I think it\u2019s called... uh, The Green Lantern? Something like that."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "The Green Lantern, okay. And was there any staff around when you slipped? Did anyone see it happen?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, there were a couple of people, and I think a bartender was nearby. They kinda rushed over after I fell."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s helpful to know. Did you happen to speak with the staff or the manager about it afterward?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I talked to the manager. He seemed, like, kinda worried and took my information, but I don\u2019t think he offered any assistance or anything."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I see. And did you get any medical attention after the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I went to the emergency room later that night because my back was killing me. They said I had a sprain and prescribed some painkillers."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really uncomfortable. Have you had any follow-up appointments or treatments since that first visit?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I\u2019ve gone to a chiropractor a few times since then. The pain has, like, gotten a bit better, but it still hurts sometimes."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m glad to hear it\u2019s improved a little, but I can imagine it\u2019s frustrating. Just to clarify, did you miss any work because of this?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I missed about two weeks. I work in retail, so it\u2019s been tough with the hours and all."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That must have been stressful. Have you been able to keep track of your medical bills and any lost wages?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I have all the bills. It\u2019s, like, a pretty big amount, but I haven\u2019t added it all up yet."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s understandable. It can be a lot to manage when you\u2019re dealing with an injury. Now, do you know if the bar has insurance that might cover incidents like this?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I think they do. The manager mentioned something about insurance, but I didn\u2019t catch the details."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, that\u2019s good to know. Did you exchange any insurance information with them?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I didn\u2019t get any info. I was just focused on my injury at the time."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s completely understandable. Now, we do like to gather a little more information to help us assess your situation. Have you had any other legal issues or representation related to this incident or any other matters?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, no. I\u2019ve never really dealt with anything like this before, but I did get in trouble a few years ago for, like, a DUI."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I appreciate your honesty. It\u2019s important for us to know these details. And just to confirm, you don\u2019t currently have another attorney representing you for this incident, right?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I don\u2019t."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great, thank you for clarifying that. It sounds like there are significant injuries and some potential coverage from the bar\u2019s insurance. I\u2019ll make sure to pass all this information along to one of our attorneys for a more thorough review."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Okay, that sounds good."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Before we wrap up, is there anything else you\u2019d like to share or any questions you have for me?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, just wondering how this whole process works? I\u2019ve never been through anything like this."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s a great question! So, once I pass your information to an attorney, they will review everything and get back to you with their thoughts. If they believe you have a case, we can discuss the next steps. And just so you know, we work on a contingency fee basis, so you won\u2019t owe anything unless we recover compensation for you."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Okay, that makes sense."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Perfect! So just to summarize, you slipped at The Green Lantern bar in Chicago on January 31st, you received medical treatment for a back injury, and you\u2019ve missed some work. You spoke with the manager but didn\u2019t exchange insurance information. You don\u2019t currently have another attorney, and you\u2019ve had some prior legal issues."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, that\u2019s all correct."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! I\u2019ll pass this information along to an attorney, and they will reach out to you soon. Thank you for calling, and take care of yourself!"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Thanks, Diana!

How can I assist you today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, hi. I, uh, I think I need some help with a dog bite incident I was involved in."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m really sorry to hear that. Dog bites can be quite serious. Can you tell me a little bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Sure. So, it was on July 12th, um, this year, I was just walking in my neighborhood in Colorado, right? And, um, I saw this dog, it was a big one, like, um, a German Shepherd or something, and it just, like, came running at me."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really frightening. Did the dog belong to someone?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, it did. I think it was, um, the neighbor's dog. They usually keep it in the backyard, but I guess it got out somehow."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Oh wow, that must have been scary. Did you get a chance to speak with your neighbor about what happened afterward?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Not really. I mean, I was kinda shocked, and, um, they were, like, really apologetic when they found out. But I didn\u2019t get to talk to them much."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I understand. So, can you describe the bite itself? Were you injured?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, um, it bit my leg. I had to go to the hospital and, like, they gave me some stitches. It was pretty painful."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I'm sorry to hear that you had to go through that. How would you say your recovery has been since the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, it\u2019s been okay, but, like, it still hurts sometimes, you know? I\u2019m worried it might leave a scar or something."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s understandable. Scarring can be a concern with dog bites. Have you been able to see a doctor for follow-up care since the initial treatment?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I had another appointment, um, a couple of weeks later, but I haven\u2019t gone back since then. They said it was healing well, though."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s good to hear that it\u2019s healing. Were you able to exchange any insurance information with your neighbor or the dog owner?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, yeah, I think they have, like, homeowner's insurance or something. I didn\u2019t get the details, though."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "No problem. It\u2019s good that they have insurance. Do you know the name of the insurance company?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I think it was, like, Allstate or State Farm? I\u2019m not really sure."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s okay; it\u2019s common to forget those details in stressful situations. Have you spoken to any other attorneys about this incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, um, you\u2019re the first place I\u2019m calling about it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it. I appreciate you reaching out to us. Just to clarify, you mentioned that the incident was on July 12th, and your leg was bitten. You did go to the hospital and received stitches, and you\u2019re concerned about potential scarring. Is that correct?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, that\u2019s right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thank you for confirming that. And, um, in terms of liability, do you know if the dog has bitten anyone else before?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I think my neighbor mentioned something about it, but I can't remember. It might have been just a bark at someone, not a bite."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, that\u2019s helpful to know, but it sounds like there\u2019s some uncertainty there. We can look into that further if you decide to move forward. What would you like to do next?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I\u2019d like to see if I can get some help with this, I guess."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Absolutely! I\u2019ll pass this information along to one of our attorneys who will review it and get back to you. They\u2019ll be able to guide you on the next steps. Just to summarize, you had a dog bite incident on July 12th in Colorado, you received medical treatment for your injury, and you\u2019re concerned about scarring. You also mentioned the possibility of the dog owner having homeowner's insurance. Is there anything else you think is important that we should know?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I don\u2019t think so. That\u2019s pretty much it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Alright, that sounds good. Thank you for sharing this information with me.

I, um, I was in a car accident, and I think I need some help with it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I'm really sorry to hear that. I can definitely help you gather some information. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, um, it was on January 27th, I think. I was driving, um, near, like, this intersection in Colorado."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it. So, January 27th, in Colorado. What happened at the intersection? Were you hit by another vehicle, or did something else occur?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh, right! So, I was, like, going through the intersection, and this other car ran the red light. They, um, hit me on the side."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really scary. I'm glad you're okay. Did you get the other driver's information? Like, did you exchange insurance details?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, yeah, I did. They, um, gave me their insurance info. I think it was with, uh, State Farm or something."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, so State Farm. That's good to know. Did the police come to the scene?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, they did! They, um, wrote a report and everything. I think I have a copy of it somewhere."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! That report can be really helpful. Now, can you tell me what kind of injuries or damages you sustained from the accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, my neck and back hurt a lot. I, uh, went to the doctor, and they said I have some whiplash. I also missed work for a few days."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I'm really sorry to hear that. Whiplash can be quite painful. How long were you out of work?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I think it was, like, three days. But I\u2019m still feeling sore and, um, it\u2019s hard to, you know, do my job sometimes."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds tough. Have you received any treatment for your injuries, like physical therapy or anything?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I started physical therapy last week. Um, they said it might take a while to feel better."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thank you for sharing that. It\u2019s important to take care of your health. Now, have you spoken to any other attorneys about your case, or are we the first ones you\u2019re reaching out to?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, you\u2019re the first. I wasn\u2019t sure what to do, so I just, uh, looked up some law firms."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I'm glad you called us! So, just to confirm, you mentioned the other driver was with State Farm. Do you know if they have any other insurance, like an umbrella policy, or just the standard auto insurance?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I\u2019m not really sure. They didn\u2019t mention anything like that. I just, like, got their name and policy number, I think."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s okay! Having their name and policy number is a good start. As far as your injuries and the damages, have you kept track of any medical bills or expenses related to the accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, yeah, I have some bills from the doctor. I haven't gotten any from the physical therapy yet, but I\u2019m, um, keeping everything."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s a smart move. Keeping track of those documents can really help your case. And, um, just to clarify, you said you missed three days of work\u2014have you lost any wages because of that?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I think I lost, um, around, like, $600 or something. I can, uh, check to be sure."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thank you for that detail. It\u2019s important to document everything, especially when it comes to lost wages. Now, I know it can be overwhelming, but we work on a contingency fee basis, so you won\u2019t owe us anything unless we get a settlement for you. Does that help ease any concerns?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, that\u2019s good to know.

Can you tell me when this happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, it was, um, August 28th this year."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, and where did this happen?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "It was in my kitchen, in Arizona."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it.

Did you suffer any injuries from the explosion?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I, um, got some cuts on my hands and arms because of the glass, and I think I might have, like, sprained my wrist trying to catch it. It hurts a lot."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m really sorry to hear that. It sounds painful. Have you sought any medical attention for your injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I went to the doctor the next day. They cleaned the cuts and gave me a brace for my wrist."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s good to hear you got medical help. Have you had any ongoing issues with your injuries since then?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, yeah, the wrist is still kinda sore, and it\u2019s hard to, like, do some things. I\u2019m worried it might take a while to heal."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I can understand why that would be concerning. Now, regarding the blender, do you know if it had any recalls or warnings associated with it?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I, uh, checked on the company\u2019s website after it happened, and there was no recall that I could find. But it, um, did have a lot of reviews saying it was faulty."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s definitely important information. Do you happen to know the name of the manufacturer or the brand of the blender?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, it was, um, called BlendMaster or something like that."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, BlendMaster. That\u2019s helpful. Did you purchase the blender directly from their website, or was it from a retailer?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I bought it from, um, Amazon."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great, and did you keep any records of the purchase, like a receipt or email confirmation?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I have the email confirmation still."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Perfect, that could be useful.

I was, um, kinda overwhelmed dealing with my injuries."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s completely understandable. It can be a lot to handle after an incident like this.

I appreciate your trust. Did you manage to get any insurance information from the manufacturer or seller?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, no, I didn\u2019t think about that at the time, but I guess it\u2019s something I should\u2019ve done."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "No worries, that\u2019s a common oversight.

Do you remember if they had any insurance coverage mentioned?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I don\u2019t know, um, I don\u2019t think they mentioned anything about insurance when I bought it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s alright. We can look into that further. Now, I know you mentioned your injuries, but do you have any other damages, like lost wages from missing work?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh, um, yeah, I missed a week of work because of the pain and, like, not being able to use my hand well."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I see. That\u2019s definitely impactful. It sounds like a tough situation. Just to clarify, you mentioned the cuts and wrist pain, but do you have any other medical expenses or treatments related to this incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, not really. Just the doctor\u2019s visit and the brace, but I\u2019m not sure how much that all costs yet."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thank you for sharing that. It's important for us to have a complete picture. So just to summarize what we've talked about: You had an incident with a BlendMaster blender that exploded while you were using it on August 28th in Arizona. You suffered cuts and a sprained wrist, and you\u2019ve seen a doctor for treatment. You bought the blender from Amazon and have the email confirmation, but haven\u2019t contacted the manufacturer yet. You also missed work due to your injuries. Is that correct?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, that sounds right!"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! I will pass this information along to one of our attorneys who will review it and get back to you. They\u2019ll be able to provide you with more detailed guidance on the next steps. Do you have any questions for me right now?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, no, I think that\u2019s it for now. Thanks for your help, Brenda."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "You\u2019re very welcome! I\u2019m glad I could assist you. If you think of any questions later, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out. We\u2019ll be in touch soon! Take care!"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Thanks!

How are you today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, I\u2019m okay, I guess. Just a bit stressed, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I completely understand. It can be really tough dealing with these situations. I\u2019m here to help, so let\u2019s see what we can do together. Can you tell me about the incident you\u2019re calling about?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, um, it was a car accident back on September 1st, 2022, in Phoenix."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, September 1st, 2022, in Phoenix. Got it. Can you describe, like, what happened during the accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Sure. I was driving home from school, um, and I was at a stop sign. Then this other car just ran the stop sign and hit me."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really scary. I\u2019m sorry you had to go through that. Were there any witnesses to the accident, or did you get the other driver\u2019s information?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, there were a few people around. Um, I got the other driver\u2019s name and insurance info, but I don\u2019t remember the insurance company right now."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "No worries, it happens! Do you happen to know if the other driver was cited for anything, like running the stop sign?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I think they got a ticket, but I\u2019m not totally sure. I was kinda in shock after it happened."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s understandable. Just getting through the initial shock can be really tough. Now, what about your injuries? Can you tell me how you were feeling right after the accident and, um, if you\u2019ve seen a doctor since then?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I went to the hospital \u2019cause my neck and back hurt a lot. They said I had some soft tissue injuries. I\u2019ve been doing physical therapy since then."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds painful. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re getting treatment. How have those injuries affected your day-to-day life? Like, have you had to miss school or anything?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I missed a couple of weeks of school. It was hard to concentrate, and I had to catch up on a lot of work. Plus, uh, my parents have been worried about me."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "It sounds like it\u2019s really been a tough time for you and your family. Have you kept records of your medical treatment or any expenses related to the accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I have all the bills and stuff from the hospital and therapy. My mom helped me keep track of everything."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s great that you\u2019ve kept all that. It will definitely help. Now, I just want to ask, did you happen to exchange insurance information with the other driver?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I think so, but, um, I\u2019m not sure if I got everything. I just remember their name was like\u2026 it was, um, Johnson, I think?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Johnson, okay. And you mentioned earlier that you got their insurance info, but you\u2019re not sure about the company. That\u2019s alright. As we move forward, we\u2019ll need to figure that out. Do you know if they had any kind of coverage?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I think they said they had insurance, but I, like, don\u2019t know the details."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Understood. That\u2019s okay. We can work on gathering that information later. Now, just to clarify, have you talked to any other attorneys about this case?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven\u2019t. I mean, my parents said we should call a lawyer, so here I am."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s good to know. I appreciate you reaching out to us. We handle cases like yours on a contingency fee basis, which means you won\u2019t have to pay anything upfront. We only get paid if we win your case. How does that sound?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "That sounds good, I guess. I just want to make sure I get, like, the help I need for my injuries."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Absolutely, and we\u2019re here to support you through this process. So, to recap, you were involved in a car accident on September 1st, 2022, in Phoenix, where another driver ran a stop sign and hit you. You\u2019ve suffered some injuries to your neck and back and have been receiving treatment. You exchanged information with the other driver, but we're still figuring out their insurance company."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, sounds right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! I\u2019ll pass this information along to one of our attorneys. They will review everything and reach out to you soon. Is there a good number for them to call you back?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, you can reach me at my cell, which is 555-123-4567."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Perfect! Thank you for providing that. Is there anything else you want to ask or discuss while we\u2019re on the line?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, not right now. I think I\u2019m okay."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Alright, thank you for your time today. I know this can be a stressful situation, but you\u2019re taking the right steps.

How can I help you today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, hi, Diana. So, I was in a car accident last summer, and I\u2019m kinda trying to figure out what to do next."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m really sorry to hear that you were in an accident. I\u2019d be happy to help you with that. Can I ask when the accident happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, it was, uh, July 27th, 2022."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it, July 27th, 2022. And where did this accident take place?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "It was in Colorado, like, near Denver."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, thank you for that. Can you tell me a bit more about how the accident happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Sure. Um, I was driving home from school, and, like, I was at this intersection. I had a green light, and then suddenly this other car just, uh, ran the red light and hit me."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Wow, that sounds really scary.

I mean, I thought it was pretty clear, but it all happened so fast."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I can only imagine how overwhelming that must have been. Did the police come to the scene?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, they did. They, um, made a report and everything. The other driver got a ticket for running the red light, I think."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s helpful to know. So it sounds like there\u2019s some evidence of liability on the other driver\u2019s part. Have you had a chance to get their insurance information?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, yeah, I think so. They were with, like, State Farm or something. I\u2019m not sure about the details, though."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, State Farm. That\u2019s a good start. Did you get your own insurance involved as well?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I called them, but I, um, I\u2019m not sure what they\u2019re doing about it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s understandable. So, let\u2019s talk a bit about your injuries. Can you describe what kind of injuries you sustained in the accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, I had a concussion and, like, my arm was really hurt. I couldn\u2019t, um, move it for a while."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m really sorry to hear that. That sounds quite serious. Have you been able to get medical treatment for your injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I went to the hospital, and they did some tests. I had to do physical therapy for my arm, like, for a few months."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds tough. Have you been able to keep track of any medical bills or expenses related to your treatment?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I think so. My mom has most of the documents. There are a lot of bills, though."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s good to hear you have those records. So, just to confirm, you mentioned your mom. Are you a minor, then?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I\u2019m 17."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thank you for letting me know. That\u2019s important as we move forward. So, have you spoken to any other attorneys about your case yet?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven\u2019t talked to anyone else. I didn\u2019t know if I should or not."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "No worries! That\u2019s totally fine. We can help you figure things out here. So, just to recap: you were in a car accident on July 27th, 2022, in Colorado, where the other driver ran a red light and hit you. You\u2019ve sustained a concussion and arm injuries, received medical treatment, and have not yet consulted with another attorney.

I, um, I wanted to talk about a dog bite incident that happened last month."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Oh no, I\u2019m really sorry to hear that. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, so it was, um, around March 19th, I think. I was, like, walking in my neighborhood in Arizona, and this dog, uh, came running out from a yard."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, so you were just walking by when the dog came out?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, exactly! I, um, I didn\u2019t see it coming. I think it was, like, a medium-sized dog, maybe a Labrador or something. It just, like, jumped at me and bit my leg."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really scary! Did you get a chance to see if the dog had an owner around?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, yes! The owner was, like, right there. They called the dog back, but it was, um, already too late."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I see. Did you manage to get the owner's information or any details about their insurance?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, yeah, I think I did. I got their name, um, it was, like, Johnson or something? And they said they had insurance, but I didn\u2019t, like, write down the company name."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, that\u2019s understandable. It can be hard to keep track of everything in such a stressful moment. Do you remember if they mentioned what kind of insurance it was?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Not really, just that they had it. I, um, I think it was a homeowner's insurance\u2026 I\u2019m not sure."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it. Now, can you tell me a bit more about your injuries? How did your leg look after the bite?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, it was pretty bad. Like, there were, uh, puncture wounds and some bleeding. I had to go to the hospital, and they, um, gave me a tetanus shot and some antibiotics."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds painful. Did you have to take any time off work because of this?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, um, I took about a week off. I work at a, um, retail store, and I couldn\u2019t walk very well."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m sorry you had to go through that. And how are you feeling now? Any lingering issues with your leg?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "It\u2019s, um, better, but there\u2019s still some pain when I, like, walk too much. I think it\u2019s, um, going to take a bit longer to fully heal."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I understand. Healing can take time. Now, have you talked to any other attorneys about this situation?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, you\u2019re the first ones I\u2019m reaching out to. I wanted to get some, like, advice first before I go anywhere else."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That makes sense, and I\u2019m glad you called us. Just to clarify, do you have any evidence like pictures of the injuries or the dog at the scene?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I took a few pictures of my leg after the bite, but, um, I didn\u2019t get a picture of the dog. I was, like, too shaken up at the moment."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s understandable. It sounds like you were in shock. Now, I know it can be a lot to process, but based on what you\u2019ve shared, it seems like there might be some challenges with liability since the owner was there."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I guess so. I just feel like, um, they should have had the dog secured, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Absolutely, it's the owner's responsibility to keep their dog safe and contained. Just a few more questions: do you remember if there were any witnesses around who might have seen the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, yeah! There were a couple of people walking their dogs nearby. They, uh, looked concerned when it happened."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s good to know. Witnesses can really help provide context. Now, I want to make sure I\u2019ve got everything summarized correctly. You were walking in your neighborhood in Arizona on March 19th, and a dog bit your leg, causing injuries that required a hospital visit. The owner was present and mentioned having insurance, but you didn\u2019t catch the company name. You\u2019re currently healing but still experiencing some pain, and you haven\u2019t spoken to any other attorneys yet. Is that about right?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, that pretty much sums it up."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! I\u2019ll pass this information along to one of our attorneys, and they\u2019ll review it and get back to you. Do you have any questions for me about the process or anything else?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, no, I think I\u2019m good for now. What happens next?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Once I pass the details to the attorney, they\u2019ll look over everything and reach out to you. We work on a contingency fee basis, so you won\u2019t owe us anything unless we recover money for you."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Okay, that sounds fair. Thanks, Carlos."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "You\u2019re welcome! Thank you for reaching out, and I hope you feel better soon.

I\u2019d be happy to gather some details so we can see how we might be able to help you. Can you start by telling me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Sure! I was driving on Main Street in Colorado, and I had the green light. Suddenly, another car ran the red light and hit me on the driver\u2019s side."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really frightening. It\u2019s good to hear you\u2019re okay. Did you get any information from the other driver or any witnesses at the scene?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I did. The other driver\u2019s name was Jamie Miller, and they gave me their insurance information. I think it was with Statewide Insurance, but I don\u2019t remember the policy number."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s helpful to know. Did the police come to the scene and file a report?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, they did. I have a copy of the police report. The officer said it was clearly the other driver\u2019s fault for running the red light."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s great to have that documentation. It really helps establish liability. Were you injured in the accident at all?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I had some neck pain and headaches that started a few days after the crash. I went to the doctor, and they said I had whiplash."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m sorry to hear that. Whiplash can be really uncomfortable. Have you been undergoing any treatment for your injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I\u2019ve been going to physical therapy for a few months now. It\u2019s been a bit of a struggle, honestly."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds tough. Physical therapy can take time. Have you had to miss work because of your injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I had to take some time off, which was frustrating. I\u2019m not sure how much it\u2019s affected my paycheck, but I know I missed a couple of weeks."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I understand how that can be stressful. It\u2019s important to be compensated for your lost wages too. Did you end up having any other damages, like car repairs or anything like that?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh, definitely. My car was pretty banged up. I had to pay out of pocket for the repairs because I was worried about how long it would take the insurance to process everything."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s understandable. It sounds like you\u2019ve incurred some significant expenses. Have you already filed a claim with the other driver\u2019s insurance?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I did file a claim with Statewide Insurance. I haven\u2019t heard back from them in a while, which is frustrating."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That can be really nerve-wracking, waiting for updates.

I was just trying to handle this myself at first, but it\u2019s been a lot."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I totally understand.

Slipping and falling can be really painful. Do you remember what caused you to slip?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, it was, like, some liquid on the floor. I think it was, um, spilled soda or something."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it.

I thought I was okay, but then, like, my back started to hurt a lot later."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I can understand how that could be concerning. Did you eventually seek medical treatment for your back pain?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, um, it took a while. I waited a couple of weeks because I thought it was just a sprain, but then it got worse, so I went to a doctor."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I see. It\u2019s important to get those things checked out, especially if the pain persists. What did the doctor say about your injury?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "They said it was, um, a strain or something like that.

Now, regarding the apartment where the incident occurred, do you know if your friend\u2019s landlord has insurance?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I think so? But I\u2019m not sure. My friend lives there, so I didn\u2019t really ask about it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "No problem. Did you both exchange any insurance information at the time of the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Not really\u2026 I, um, didn\u2019t think about that. I was just focused on my back hurting."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s completely understandable. In situations like this, it\u2019s not uncommon to feel overwhelmed. Do you recall if your friend mentioned anything about the building's maintenance or if there had been previous incidents like this?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I don\u2019t think so. Um, I think they just moved in not long before that."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, thanks for clarifying. So, just to recap, you were at your friend\u2019s apartment in Denver on June 9th, 2022, and you slipped on some liquid in the hallway, which caused back pain that you later sought treatment for. Is that correct?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, that sounds about right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! Now, I know this is a tough topic, but I want to ask\u2014were you under the influence of any substances at the time of the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh, um, yeah. I had a couple of drinks earlier in the evening. But I thought I was fine to walk."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thank you for being honest with me. That\u2019s an important detail to consider. Just a couple more questions\u2014have you spoken to any other attorneys about this situation?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven\u2019t. You\u2019re the first one I\u2019m talking to."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thanks for choosing us! And finally, do you know if your friend has any renter's insurance that might cover incidents like this?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I\u2019m not really sure about that either. I\u2019ll have to ask them."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s totally fine. It\u2019s a lot to keep track of. So, to summarize: you slipped on a liquid in your friend's apartment, you sustained back injuries that required medical treatment, and you haven't spoken to any other attorneys. I'll pass this information along to one of our attorneys who will review it and get back to you."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Okay, that sounds good."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! Before we wrap up, do you have any questions about the process or our fees?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, yeah. How does that work?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "We work on a contingency fee basis, which means we only get paid if you win your case. So, there are no upfront costs for you."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh, that\u2019s good to know."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Absolutely! I\u2019ll make sure to note everything we discussed today, and one of our attorneys will reach out to you soon. Thank you for your time, and I hope you start feeling better!"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Thank you! I appreciate it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "You\u2019re welcome! Have a great day!"}], "outcome_status": "settled", "outcome_value": 15000}

How can I help you today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, hi. I, um, I was in a car accident a few weeks ago, and I think I might need some help with it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I'm really sorry to hear that. I can help you out with that. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, um, it was on February 15th, I think. I was driving in Austin, and, like, I got rear-ended by this other car. It was, um, pretty sudden."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really stressful. So, just to clarify, you were the one who was hit from behind, right?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, that's right! I was just stopped at a red light, and then boom! This car hit me, like, outta nowhere."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, got it. And do you remember what kind of car hit you? Like, was it a truck or a sedan, or\u2026?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh, um, I think it was a sedan, but I didn\u2019t really see the make or model. It was just, like, a regular car, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Yeah, I understand. That can happen in the moment. Did you happen to get the driver's information or their insurance details?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, yeah, I got their name, but I, uh, I think I forgot to ask for their insurance info. I don\u2019t remember, like, their insurance company or anything."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, that\u2019s helpful to know. Just to confirm, did you get any contact info, like a phone number or an address?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh, um, yeah! I think I got their phone number. But it\u2019s kinda fuzzy right now. I, um, remember they seemed nice about it, though."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s good to hear they were cooperative. Now, regarding the accident, did the police come to the scene? Were there any reports filed?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I don\u2019t think they came. I mean, I called them, but they said it wasn\u2019t, like, a serious accident or something, so I guess they didn\u2019t."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I see. That can be a little tricky. So, do you have any injuries from the accident? Like, did you go to a doctor or anything afterward?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh, yeah! I, um, I had this really bad pain in my neck and, like, my back felt sore for a couple of days. I went to the doctor, um, maybe a week later? They said I might have whiplash or something."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really uncomfortable. I\u2019m glad you saw a doctor. Did they give you any specific treatments or medications for your pain?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, yeah. They gave me some pain meds and, like, told me to rest. I haven\u2019t really been able to, um, go back to work since then."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That must be tough for you. Have you kept track of any medical bills or expenses related to your treatment?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Umm, I think I have some receipts, but, like, I haven\u2019t organized them yet. It\u2019s all kinda messy."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "No worries, that happens! Just trying to get a sense of everything. And, um, were there any damages to your car?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh, uh, just a little scratch? It\u2019s not, like, super damaged or anything. Just, um, a little ding, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I see. So, minimal property damage, then. Have you talked to your insurance company about the accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, not really, no. I mean, I called them, but I was kinda confused about what to say. I just told them, like, I was in an accident, and they said, um, they\u2019d look into it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s understandable. Just to clarify, have you had any discussions with any other attorneys regarding this accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven\u2019t. You\u2019re the first, um, law firm I\u2019m talking to about it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, that\u2019s helpful to know. So, just to summarize everything: You were rear-ended on February 15th in Austin, you didn\u2019t get the other driver\u2019s insurance details, there wasn\u2019t a police report, you saw a doctor for neck and back pain, and there\u2019s minimal damage to your car.

Slip and fall accidents can be really tough. Can you tell me a little more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, so it was, like, back in April of last year, I think? I was at this grocery store in Chicago, and, um, there was, like, this puddle on the floor. I slipped and fell."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Ouch, that sounds painful. Was there any signage or anything warning about the wet floor?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I don't think so? Well, I mean, there might have been, but I can\u2019t really remember. It was, like, a busy day, so I wasn\u2019t really paying attention, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I totally get that. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to focus in a busy environment. Do you recall if anyone saw the accident happen?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, there were a few people around. I think one lady came up to help me, but, um, I didn\u2019t get her name or anything."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it. And how about the store staff? Did anyone come over after your fall to check on you?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, yeah, I think they did, but I can't remember exactly what they said. I think they were, like, trying to clean it up right after."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s understandable! It sounds like there might be some accountability there, especially if they knew about the puddle. Were you able to exchange any insurance information with the store?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh, um, I didn\u2019t really talk to their insurance or anything. I just, like, filed a report with the store. I think they said they would follow up, but I didn\u2019t hear back."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, so you haven\u2019t gotten any updates from them yet? And just to clarify, did you happen to get any information about their insurance policy, like the name of the insurance company?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, no, I don\u2019t think I got that. I was kind of in shock after the fall, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s completely understandable\u2014accidents can be really overwhelming. Now, can you tell me about any injuries you sustained from the fall?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh, right! So, I, like, hurt my ankle and my back. It was pretty bad... I think I might\u2019ve sprained my ankle? I had to go to the doctor, and they gave me some pain meds."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you're feeling better now. Did you have to miss work because of your injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, yeah, I missed a couple of weeks. I was, like, in a lot of pain, you know? But I think I went back to work after that."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That makes sense. It sounds like you had a tough time. Just to clarify, have you kept any records of your medical visits or, like, any expenses related to the accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I have some paperwork from the doctor, but, like, I haven\u2019t really kept track of everything. I should probably do that, huh?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Yes, that would definitely help if you decide to move forward with a claim. Now, I want to ask\u2014do you currently have another attorney representing you for this case?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, yeah, I do, but I\u2019m not really sure about them. I just, like, feel like they haven\u2019t done much yet."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I see. It\u2019s important to feel comfortable with your representation. If you\u2019re considering exploring other options, we can help with that. Have you discussed your concerns with your current attorney?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, not really. I just, like, haven\u2019t had the time, you know? I guess I should."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That makes sense. It can be hard to find the time to address these things. Just to summarize what we\u2019ve talked about: you had a slip and fall accident at a grocery store in Chicago back in April of last year, where you sustained injuries to your ankle and back. You filed a report with the store, but you haven\u2019t received any updates about their insurance.

I think they might have gotten a ticket."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s okay. It might be worth checking the police report for that information.

Have you had any expenses related to the accident, like medical bills or car repairs?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Well, I have the medical bills from the doctor visits and physical therapy. My car was also damaged, but I got it fixed. I had to pay for the repairs out of pocket, though."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I see.

I was just, um, walking my dog in the park, and this other dog, a big one, just came out of nowhere and, like, attacked us."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really frightening. I\u2019m sorry you had to go through that. Do you remember if the other dog was on a leash?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, no, no leash. It was just running around.

Did you manage to get the owner's contact information or any insurance details?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I got their name, um, I think it was like, uh, Smith or something.

How are you feeling now, like, any ongoing issues or concerns?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, it\u2019s getting better, but I still have some swelling and it\u2019s kinda hard to move my hand. I\u2019m worried about, um, infection or something."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s totally understandable. It\u2019s important to keep an eye on that. Have you had any other injuries or issues prior to this incident that we should know about?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Well, I guess I had a wrist injury a while back, but it was, um, healed before this happened. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s related, though."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thanks for sharing that. It\u2019s good to know. I just want to make sure we have all the details. So, there were no other injuries or medical issues before this incident other than that wrist injury, right?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Right, yeah, just the wrist."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great, thanks for clarifying. Now, do you know if the dog owner has any type of renters or homeowners insurance that might cover this incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "They mentioned homeowners insurance, but, um, I didn\u2019t get the specifics.

I was just, um, a bit shocked, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s totally understandable. It\u2019s a lot to process.

Have you had any medical bills or other expenses related to this incident that you can share?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I had to pay for the doctor's visit and the medication, but, uh, I don\u2019t know how much it was. I just, like, paid out of pocket for the visit."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thanks for sharing that. It sounds like this incident has really impacted you. Just to clarify, have you spoken to any other attorneys about this incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven\u2019t. I, um, wanted to talk to you guys first before I, like, made any decisions."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s perfectly fine! We appreciate you reaching out to us first. So, just to summarize, you were bitten by a dog on June 24th while walking in your neighborhood in Seattle. The dog was off-leash, and you spoke to the owner, but did not exchange insurance information. You\u2019ve been dealing with a painful infection that has affected your daily activities and work, and you\u2019ve incurred some medical expenses. Is that correct?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, that sounds right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! I\u2019ll make sure to pass this information along to one of our attorneys. They\u2019ll review everything and get back to you about the next steps. Just a quick note, we work on a contingency fee basis, which means you don\u2019t pay unless we win your case."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh, that\u2019s good to know! Thanks for explaining that."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Of course! If you have any other questions, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I\u2019ll make sure to get this info to our team, and they\u2019ll reach out soon."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I think that\u2019s it for now. Thank you so much, Carlos!"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "You\u2019re welcome! Take care of yourself, and I hope you feel better soon.

How can I help you today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Hi, um, I\u2019m calling about a dog bite incident that happened a little while ago."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m sorry to hear that you went through that. I\u2019d be happy to gather some information so we can understand your situation better. When did this incident take place?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "It was, um, on February 10th, 2021."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thank you for that date. And can you tell me where in Chicago this happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "It was in a park, I think it\u2019s called Lincoln Park? Yeah, Lincoln Park."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it, Lincoln Park. Can you describe what happened during the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Well, I was just walking, you know, enjoying the day, and this dog, um, it came out of nowhere. It wasn\u2019t on a leash or anything, and it just jumped on me and bit my leg."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really frightening. I hope you\u2019re okay. Did you seek any medical attention after the bite?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I did. I went to the hospital because it was bleeding pretty bad. They cleaned it up and gave me a tetanus shot."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m glad you got medical help. How would you describe your injuries now? Are you still experiencing any issues from the bite?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, it\u2019s mostly healed now, but there\u2019s a scar, and sometimes it hurts a little when I walk too much."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I understand. Scarring can be a constant reminder. Now, do you know who owned the dog that bit you?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, it was a woman who was, like, sitting on a bench nearby. I think her name was, um, Sarah? I don\u2019t remember her last name, though."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s okay! Did you happen to exchange any insurance information with her?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I didn\u2019t. I was, um, so shocked and didn\u2019t think to ask for it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s understandable, especially in such a surprising situation. Did you file a report with animal control or the police?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I think someone called animal control, but, um, I didn\u2019t directly report it myself."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thanks for clarifying that. So, just to summarize\u2014this incident happened at Lincoln Park on February 10th, 2021, you were bitten by a dog owned by a woman named Sarah, and you received medical treatment for the bite, which left a scar and caused some pain. Is there anything else you\u2019d like to add about the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I think that covers it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, that\u2019s really helpful. One more thing\u2014have you spoken with any other attorney about this case or received any legal advice?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven\u2019t talked to anyone else about it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great, thanks for letting me know. Now, I want to mention that we work on a contingency fee basis, which means we only get paid if we win your case. Does that make sense?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, that sounds good."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Perfect! I\u2019ll pass this information over to one of our attorneys. They\u2019ll review everything and get back to you soon.

How can I help you today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Hi, Alex. I\u2019m calling about an accident I had last year."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m really sorry to hear that you were in an accident. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Sure! It was on September 2nd, 2021, in Austin, Texas. I was at this restaurant, and I slipped on a wet floor. There were no warning signs or anything."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really dangerous. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re okay enough to talk about it. Were you injured in the fall?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I ended up with a pretty bad sprain in my ankle and some bruising. I had to go to the hospital and get an X-ray, but thankfully there were no fractures."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That must have been quite painful. Have you had any ongoing issues with your ankle since the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, actually. The sprain took a long time to heal, and I still have some pain when I walk too much or run. I\u2019ve had to go to physical therapy for a few months."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I see. It sounds like you\u2019ve been through a lot. Have you received any other medical treatments for your injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Just the physical therapy. I also had some pain medication prescribed for a while, but it was mostly just to help manage the pain during recovery."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thank you for sharing that. It\u2019s important to have all the details. Now, can I ask if you reported the incident to the restaurant or if anyone was there to witness it?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I told the manager right away. There were a couple of other customers who saw what happened, too."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s good to know. Did you happen to exchange information with the manager or get any details about the restaurant\u2019s insurance?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I didn\u2019t get the insurance info directly, but the manager said they would file a report. I think they have insurance, but I'm not sure which company."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s understandable. We can look into that further if you decide to pursue a case. Did you happen to take any photos of the area where you slipped?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I didn\u2019t think to take photos at the time, but I did take some pictures of my ankle later on."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Those photos can still be useful. Thank you for mentioning that. Just to clarify, have you already spoken with another attorney about this incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven\u2019t. I was still figuring out what to do."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thanks for letting me know. It\u2019s good that you reached out to us. Now, can you tell me if there were any signs indicating that the floor was wet, or if there were any other safety measures in place?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Not that I remember. I think they should have had a sign up. It was just really slippery, and I didn\u2019t see anything."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it. It does sound like there could be a case for premises liability if they didn\u2019t have proper warning signs. One last thing, do you have any idea if the restaurant has liability insurance, or do you know if they own the property or rent it?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I think they rent it, but I\u2019m not entirely sure about the insurance part."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s completely fine. We can work with that information. Just to summarize, you were injured in a slip and fall accident at a restaurant in Austin last September, you received treatment including physical therapy, and you haven\u2019t spoken to another attorney. Is there anything else you think is important for us to know?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I think that covers it all."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! I\u2019ll pass this information along to one of our attorneys who will review it and get back to you. They may have more questions, but we\u2019ll keep you in the loop. We work on a contingency fee basis, so you won\u2019t have any upfront costs."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Okay, that sounds good.

It was a product defect case, I think."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I'm sorry to hear that you've been dealing with this. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Sure! It was on Valentine\u2019s Day, 2022. I was using a kitchen appliance\u2014a blender, actually\u2014and it just exploded out of nowhere while I was blending. I got cut by the glass."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Oh wow, that sounds really dangerous! I hope you\u2019re doing okay now. Can you tell me where this happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "It was in my kitchen in Atlanta, Georgia."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it. And just to clarify, was the blender something you purchased yourself, or was it a gift?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I bought it myself, um, online. I can\u2019t remember the exact website, but I think it was a popular retailer."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That makes sense. Do you recall if you received any instructions or warnings about the product when you purchased it?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I think there was a manual, but I didn\u2019t read it too closely. There were definitely some safety warnings, though."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay. Now, can you describe the injuries you sustained from the explosion?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I had some pretty deep cuts on my arm and hand. I had to go to the hospital to get stitches. It was really painful, and I still have scars from it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m really sorry to hear that. It sounds quite serious. Have you been able to receive any follow-up treatment or therapy for those injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I had to go for follow-ups for a few months, and I did physical therapy to help with the movement in my hand. It was a lot more complicated than I thought it would be."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds like a tough experience. Have you had any other injuries or medical issues before this incident that you think might be relevant?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I had some carpal tunnel issues, but nothing like this. I mean, I didn\u2019t think it was that serious until this happened."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I understand. It\u2019s important to mention those previous conditions, though, as they can sometimes come into play with these types of cases. Now, do you happen to know if the company that made the blender has any liability insurance?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I\u2019m not sure. I didn\u2019t get any information directly from them, but I did reach out to their customer service after it happened. They were pretty unhelpful, to be honest."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s frustrating. Did you at least get the name of the company or any contact information when you reached out?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, it was called BlendTech or something like that. I can look it up if you need me to."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "No problem, I believe you. We can always find that information later. Did you exchange insurance information with anyone after the incident, or did you file a claim with your own insurance?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, um, I didn\u2019t really think about insurance at the time. I was just focused on my injuries and getting to the hospital."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That makes complete sense. It\u2019s tough to think about those things when you're in pain. Now, I see that you mentioned this is a product defect case. Have you consulted with any other attorneys about this?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I did talk to a lawyer a few months ago, but I wasn\u2019t really feeling confident about their approach. I\u2019m looking for someone who\u2019s more proactive, I guess."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I see. It\u2019s important to feel comfortable with your legal representation. Just to confirm, did you sign any agreements with that attorney?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I didn't sign anything. We just had an initial conversation."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it. That\u2019s helpful to know. Now, regarding the injuries and treatments you\u2019ve had, would you say you're still experiencing any issues or limitations because of the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, my hand, um, it still gives me trouble sometimes. I can\u2019t grip things as well as I used to, and that\u2019s been really frustrating."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I'm really sorry to hear that. It sounds like this has had a significant impact on your daily life. Before we wrap things up, can you tell me if you\u2019ve kept any records of your medical treatments or any expenses related to the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I have all the medical bills and my therapy receipts. I\u2019ve been keeping track of everything as best as I can."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s great to hear. Keeping those records will be really helpful. So just to summarize, you had an incident with a blender that exploded on Valentine\u2019s Day last year, resulting in serious injuries to your arm and hand. You\u2019ve had medical treatment and therapy, and you\u2019re looking for someone who can better represent your interests. You\u2019ve talked to another attorney but haven\u2019t signed anything with them. Is there anything else you'd like to add or any questions you have for me?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, that covers it. Thanks for listening!"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Of course! I\u2019ll pass all this information along to one of our attorneys for review.

Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, so, um, I was using this product, like, a kitchen appliance, and it, um, malfunctioned."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I see. That sounds frustrating. What kind of appliance was it, and what exactly happened when it malfunctioned?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "It was a blender, you know? I was, um, trying to blend some smoothies, and the, uh, lid wasn\u2019t on right or something. It, like, exploded everywhere, and I ended up, um, cutting my hand on the glass."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Oh no! That sounds really painful. I\u2019m sorry to hear that. Did you need any medical treatment for your hand?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Well, I, uh, didn't go right away. I thought it was, um, just a small cut, but it got worse, and then, like, I had to go to the clinic a few days later."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I understand. So you experienced some delay in seeking medical treatment. Did they give you any specific diagnosis or treatment for the injury?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, they, um, cleaned it up and put some stitches in. They said it was, like, a deep cut, but now it's, um, healing okay."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s good to hear that it\u2019s healing! Just to clarify, did you have any follow-up appointments after the stitches were taken out?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I didn\u2019t need to go back. It, um, wasn't too bad after that."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it. So, regarding the blender\u2014do you know if it was still under warranty or if there was a recall for that product?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I, um, checked the warranty and it was still under it. I don\u2019t think there was a recall, though."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thank you for that information. Did you happen to contact the manufacturer or retailer about the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I tried calling them, but, um, they didn\u2019t really take me seriously. They said it was, like, my fault or something."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That must have been frustrating. Did you happen to get any documentation or notes from your conversations with them?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I, um, didn\u2019t think to keep that. I just got upset and hung up."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s understandable. So, it sounds like you were using the product as intended, but something went wrong. How would you describe the extent of the damage to your property, like the kitchen or anything else?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, well, the blender was, like, ruined, but I didn\u2019t really have any other damage. It was mostly just a mess everywhere."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it. So, minimal property damage overall. Now, can I ask if you\u2019ve spoken to any other attorneys about this incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven\u2019t, um, talked to anyone else yet."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s helpful to know. Now, about the blender, did you get any insurance information from the manufacturer or the place you bought it?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I didn\u2019t ask for that. I wasn\u2019t sure if they\u2019d help me, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That's understandable. Sometimes it can feel daunting. Just to clarify, was there any other medical treatment required, like physical therapy or anything like that?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, just the stitches and, um, some cream for the cut."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, thanks for that detail. So, to summarize: you had an incident with a blender on March 17, 2022, in Chicago. You sustained a deep cut when it malfunctioned, leading to a delayed medical treatment where you received stitches. You haven\u2019t contacted any other attorneys or received insurance information from the manufacturer.

When did this happen?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I think it was, like, September 25, 2021? Yeah, that sounds right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it, September 25, 2021. And where did the accident take place?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "In Chicago, Illinois."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thank you for that information. Can you tell me a bit about how the accident occurred?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Right, so I was, um, driving down this street, and I had the green light, and then this other car just, like, ran the red light and hit me."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really stressful. I can imagine how shocking that must have been. Were there any witnesses to the accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I think there were a couple of people, like, standing around, but I didn\u2019t really get their names or anything."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s okay. Sometimes, it\u2019s hard to keep track in the moment. Did you exchange insurance information with the other driver?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, yeah, I did. Their insurance was, um, I think it was State Farm?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, State Farm. And did you happen to get their policy number or anything like that?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I don\u2019t think I got the policy number. Just, like, their name and their insurance company."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s understandable. Can you tell me about any injuries you sustained from the accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh, yeah. I, um, had a pretty bad neck injury. I\u2019ve been going to physical therapy since then. And, like, I think I might have a concussion too, but I\u2019m not sure."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m really sorry to hear that. Neck injuries can be quite serious. Have you had any medical treatment for those injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I went to the hospital right after the accident.

I still go, like, once a week."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "It's good to hear you're receiving treatment. Have you missed work because of your injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I missed, um, like, a month of work right after the accident. And even now, I\u2019ve had to take some time off for therapy."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really challenging. So, just to clarify, you\u2019ve had significant medical expenses and lost wages from this incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, definitely. The bills are piling up, and, um, I\u2019m kinda stressed about it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I can understand that. It\u2019s important to get the help you need.

My name is Diana, and I\u2019m here to help you today. How can I assist you?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Hi, um, I\u2019m calling about a dog bite incident that happened a while ago."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m really sorry to hear that you went through something like that. Can I ask when this incident happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, it was on July 18th, 2021."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thanks for that. And where did this incident take place?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "It was in Arizona, in my neighborhood park."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, got it. So, can you tell me a bit more about what happened during the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Sure. I was playing with my dog, and then this other dog just came running over and, um, bit me on the leg. I didn\u2019t see it coming at all."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really frightening! Was the other dog on a leash, or was it loose in the park?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "It was loose. The owner was, like, a few feet away, but didn\u2019t do anything until after the bite happened."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I see. So, it seems like the owner might have some responsibility here. Did you happen to exchange information with the dog owner?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I got their name and phone number. They said they\u2019d take care of any medical bills, but I didn\u2019t get any insurance info."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Alright, that\u2019s helpful. Just to clarify, did you get the owner\u2019s name and contact info, or was there any other witness information?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I got the owner\u2019s name, um, it was, like, Chris Miller. And there were some people nearby, but I didn\u2019t think to get their details."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "No problem, Chris Miller is a start. Now, can you tell me about the injuries you sustained from the bite?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, it was pretty bad. I had to go to the emergency room. I got stitches, and I\u2019ve been having, like, pain and swelling since then."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Ouch, that sounds really painful. Have you had any follow-up treatments or anything since then?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I had a few follow-up visits to the doctor, and I\u2019m, um, still dealing with some pain. They said I might need physical therapy."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s definitely a lot to go through. Have you kept any records of your medical visits or expenses related to the bite?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I have some documents from the ER and the follow-up visits. I think I also have the bills, but I need to check."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That would be really useful for us. I just want to confirm, are you currently working with another attorney on this case?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I\u2019m not. I haven\u2019t really known what to do about it until now."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s totally understandable. We\u2019re here to help you figure it out. Since you mentioned the owner said they would cover the medical bills, did you have any conversations about their insurance company?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, they didn\u2019t mention any insurance. I just assumed they would handle the bills directly."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Alright, that makes sense. Since they didn't provide any insurance information, we might need to explore that further. Have there been any other incidents involving that dog or owner that you know of?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Not that I know of, but I heard some people in the park mention that the dog was aggressive before."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s important information. It could help establish a pattern of behavior. Now, just to recap everything: you were bitten by a loose dog in the park on July 18th, 2021. You\u2019ve had significant injuries, including stitches and ongoing pain, and you have medical documents related to your treatment. You\u2019ve spoken with the dog owner, Chris Miller, but you don\u2019t have their insurance information yet, and you\u2019re not currently working with another attorney."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, that sounds right!"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! I\u2019ll pass this information along to one of our attorneys who will review it and reach out to you. Just a quick note, we work on a contingency fee basis, which means you won\u2019t pay any fees unless we recover compensation for you."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh, that\u2019s good to know!"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Absolutely! If you have any other questions or if there\u2019s anything else you\u2019d like to add, feel free to ask."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, no, I think that\u2019s it for now.

How can I help you today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Hi, uh, I'm calling about a car accident I was in last year."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m so sorry to hear that. Can you tell me a little more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, um, it was on August 3rd, 2022, in Atlanta. I was just driving to work when, um, this guy ran a red light and hit me."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Oh no, that sounds really stressful! Were you injured in the accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I, um, hurt my back and my neck. It\u2019s been bothering me for a while now."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I can imagine that must be really frustrating. Have you seen a doctor for your injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I went to a clinic like a week after the accident. They did some X-rays and gave me prescription painkillers. I\u2019ve been going for physical therapy too."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s good to hear you\u2019re getting treatment. How\u2019s the therapy been working for you?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, it helps a bit, but I still have pain, like, every day. It\u2019s hard to work and do normal stuff."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m sorry to hear that. It sounds really tough. Can I ask if you have any previous injuries to your back or neck before this accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, well, I\u2019ve had some issues in the past, but it wasn\u2019t as bad as this. I guess I did hurt my back a few years ago but nothing like this."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thanks for sharing that. It\u2019s important for us to know all the details. Now, can you tell me what the other driver said, or if they admitted any fault at the scene?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, they didn\u2019t really say much, but, like, the police report said they ran the red light. I think they might have been trying to blame me, though."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s helpful to know. Did you manage to get the other driver\u2019s insurance information?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I got their insurance info. It\u2019s with, um, State Farm, I think."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! That\u2019s helpful. Did you happen to exchange contact information with them as well?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I got their name and number, but, um, I haven\u2019t talked to them since the accident."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Understood. That\u2019s completely okay. Now, have you had a chance to file a claim with their insurance company?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, yeah, I did that. I think they said they\u2019re investigating or something."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s good that you\u2019ve started the claim process. Do you happen to know if they\u2019ve offered any compensation yet?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Not yet. I think they\u2019re waiting for all the medical stuff to come in."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, that makes sense. Now, just to clarify, have you spoken to any other attorneys about this case?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, you\u2019re the first. I, um, didn\u2019t know if I should get a lawyer or not."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m glad you reached out! It\u2019s definitely a good idea to have someone on your side, especially since you're dealing with injuries. Just to recap, you were in an accident on August 3rd, 2022, in Atlanta, where another driver ran a red light and hit you. You\u2019ve been getting treatment for your injuries, but it\u2019s still challenging for you. You have their insurance info with State Farm, but no compensation has been offered yet."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, that sounds right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Perfect! I\u2019ll pass all this information along to one of our attorneys, and they\u2019ll review it and get back to you soon. We work on a contingency fee basis, which means we only get paid if you do. Do you have any questions about the process or anything else before we wrap up?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, no, I think I\u2019m okay for now. Thanks for your help."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "You\u2019re welcome! I hope you start feeling better soon.

How are you doing today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I\u2019m okay, I guess. Just a bit stressed about everything."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I totally understand. It sounds like you\u2019ve been through a lot. I\u2019m here to help you with your situation. Can you tell me what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Sure. So, it was on March 23rd, 2025, in Phoenix. I was driving home from work when, out of nowhere, another car just... ran a red light and crashed into me."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Oh no, that sounds really scary! I\u2019m glad you\u2019re okay. Can you tell me a bit more about how the accident happened? Were there any witnesses?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, there were a couple of people who saw it. They said the other driver was speeding and didn\u2019t even try to stop."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That definitely sounds like a clear case of liability. Did the police come to the scene?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, they did. They wrote a report and everything. The other driver got a ticket for running the red light."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s good to hear. It helps establish liability. Now, did you exchange insurance information with the other driver?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, yeah, I think so. Their insurance was, uh, something like State Farm? I\u2019m not entirely sure."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "No problem, that\u2019s helpful! State Farm is a major insurance company. Did you happen to get their policy number, or was there anything else you remember about the insurance?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I didn\u2019t get the policy number. I was just kinda in shock after the crash, you know? But I do remember the agent saying something about coverage."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s completely understandable. It can be really overwhelming in those moments. Now, can you tell me about any injuries you sustained from the accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Well, I have this pretty bad neck pain and some bruising on my arm. I went to the hospital right after, and they said it could take a while to heal."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m really sorry to hear that. Neck injuries can be quite serious. Have you followed up with a doctor since your hospital visit?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I went to see my primary doctor a week later. They gave me some pain medication and recommended physical therapy."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds like a good plan. Physical therapy can really help with recovery. Have you had to miss work because of your injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I\u2019ve missed about two weeks so far. I just can\u2019t sit at my desk for long periods without pain."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s tough. It\u2019s definitely important to take care of your health before anything else. Have you kept track of any medical expenses or lost wages from missing work?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I have some receipts from the hospital and, like, my pay stubs showing the days I missed. I haven\u2019t totaled them yet, though."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s a great start! Keeping all those records will be really helpful down the line. Now, just to clarify, do you already have another attorney representing you in this matter?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I don\u2019t have anyone yet. I was just looking for some advice before I decide what to do."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s completely fine. I\u2019m glad you reached out. We work on a contingency fee basis, so you won\u2019t owe us anything unless we secure compensation for you. Does that sound okay?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, that makes sense. I just want to make sure I\u2019m doing everything right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Absolutely! You\u2019re doing great by gathering this information. So, to summarize what we\u2019ve talked about: you were in a car accident on March 23rd in Phoenix, where another driver ran a red light and hit you. You have neck pain and bruising and have missed work due to your injuries. You exchanged insurance information with the other driver, who has State Farm, and you haven\u2019t retained another attorney yet."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yep, that sounds right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Perfect! I\u2019ll pass all of this information along to one of our attorneys. They\u2019ll review it and get back to you soon. Is there anything else you\u2019d like to ask me in the meantime?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I think that covers it.

I, uh, I need to talk about a dog bite incident I had, um, a while back."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Of course, I\u2019m sorry to hear that you had to go through that. Can you tell me when the incident happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, it was, uh, May 13th, 2023."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it. And where did this happen?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "It was, um, in Colorado. I was, like, at a park or something."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thanks for that detail. Can you describe what happened during the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Sure, so I was just, you know, walking in the park, and, um, this dog just ran at me outta nowhere. It, like, bit my leg."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Oh no, that sounds really scary! Was the dog on a leash at the time?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, it wasn\u2019t. Um, the owner was, like, a few feet away, and they didn\u2019t even see it happen at first."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I see. So, was the owner present when the dog bit you?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, they were there, but, um, they seemed kinda distracted, like, talking to someone else."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That must have been frustrating. Did you manage to get the owner's contact information or any insurance details?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I, um, got their name and number, but I think the dog\u2019s owner said something about their renter\u2019s insurance or whatever."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, that\u2019s helpful to know. Do you remember the insurance company\u2019s name?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, it was something like, uh, State Farm? No, wait, it was, uh, Allstate, I think."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thanks for clarifying that. Now, can you tell me about your injuries? How have you been feeling since the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh man, it\u2019s been rough. I had, like, some serious puncture wounds on my leg, and I had to get stitches. Then, um, I had to go to physical therapy too."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m really sorry to hear that. How long have you been in therapy?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Ugh, it\u2019s been, like, three months now. I still feel pain sometimes, especially after I walk for a while."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really tough. Have you been able to work during this time?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, kinda? I\u2019ve missed a lotta days, like, my boss has been understanding, but, um, it\u2019s been hard to keep up with everything."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I can imagine. It\u2019s important to take care of yourself. Have you already spoken to another attorney about this case?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I talked to someone, but, um, I don't think they're really helping me much."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I understand. It\u2019s important to find someone who fits your needs. Can you tell me why you feel that way about your current attorney?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Well, they\u2019re just, like, really hard to reach. I don\u2019t know, um, it just feels like they\u2019re not invested in my case."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s frustrating for sure. We want to make sure you get the attention your case deserves. Just to confirm, have you received any medical bills or documentation related to your treatment?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh, yeah, I have a stack of bills from the hospital and the therapy sessions."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s good to have. And are there any other damages you think might be relevant, like lost wages or anything else?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, um, I\u2019ve lost some work hours and, ugh, it\u2019s adding up."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I appreciate you sharing that. It sounds like you've been through a lot. Just a couple more questions: did your injuries lead to any criminal activity on your part, or were you involved in any way?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, yeah, I, um, I had a bit of a rough patch before this incident, and I got arrested for something unrelated a few months prior."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I see, thank you for being honest about that. It\u2019s important to be upfront about all aspects of your situation. Now, just to summarize, you were bitten by a dog in Colorado on May 13th, the owner was present but distracted, and you\u2019ve sustained significant injuries that have impacted your work and resulted in medical bills.

I\u2019m here to help. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, so, um, it was on September 24, 2022. I was at a friend's birthday party in Chicago, and, uh, I ended up falling down some stairs."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m really sorry to hear that. Falling down stairs can be really serious. Can you describe how the fall happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Sure. So, um, there were some people in front of me, and I was trying to go down to get some drinks, but the stairs were, like, super slippery. There was, um, some spilled soda or something on the steps. I didn\u2019t see it until it was too late."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really dangerous. Did anyone else witness the fall or mention anything about the slippery stairs?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, there were a few people there. They said it was, like, a hazard and that it should\u2019ve been cleaned up."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s important to know. Was there any signage or warnings about the slippery stairs?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, not that I saw. I think if they had, I wouldn't have gone down there, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Absolutely, that makes sense. It sounds like there may have been some clear liability on their part. Can you tell me about any injuries you sustained from the fall?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh, um, it was pretty bad. I ended up breaking my wrist and I had some really bad bruising on my side. I also, like, hit my head a little bit."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really painful. I hope you\u2019re feeling a bit better now. Did you receive any medical treatment for your injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I did, but it took me a while to go to the doctor. I didn\u2019t want to, um, ruin the party, so I just waited a couple of days before I saw someone."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I understand that. Sometimes we don\u2019t want to make a fuss, but it\u2019s good you eventually sought help. Were you prescribed any medications or therapies after the visit?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, they gave me some pain medication and told me to do physical therapy for my wrist."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it. And, um, how are you feeling about your recovery now?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "It\u2019s still not great. I mean, my wrist is, like, pretty stiff, and I can\u2019t do some of the things I used to do."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m really sorry to hear that. It must be frustrating to deal with ongoing pain and limitations. Now, regarding the party where the accident happened, do you know if the venue or the homeowner had insurance?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I think they do, but I\u2019m not sure what company it is. Um, I didn\u2019t get that information at the time."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s okay! It\u2019s common not to think about those details in the moment. Do you remember if anyone exchanged insurance information after the accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I don\u2019t think so. Everyone was just, like, checking on me and stuff."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Understood. Just to clarify, do you currently have another attorney representing you for this incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I don\u2019t.

I, um, I wanted to talk about an accident I had a little while ago."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Of course, Jamie. I\u2019m really sorry to hear that you\u2019ve been in an accident. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, it was, um, on August 4th, 2020. I was at this, um, like a local grocery store in Austin, Texas. I slipped and fell."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Oh no, that sounds really painful! I hope you\u2019re okay. Can you tell me a bit more about the circumstances of the fall? What caused you to slip?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "So, um, there was this, like, liquid on the floor near the produce section. I think someone knocked over a drink or something. There were no signs or anything warning about it, and then, yeah, I just went down hard."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s really unfortunate, Jamie. It sounds like the store might have had a responsibility to keep the area safe. Were there any employees around when that happened? Did you report it to anyone?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, there were a couple of employees nearby. I, um, I told one of them right after I fell. They called a manager over, but, uh, I didn't stick around to talk to them too much. I was in a lot of pain."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That makes sense. It\u2019s tough to think clearly in those situations. Did you happen to take any pictures of the area where you fell, or did anyone witness the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I didn\u2019t take any pictures. I was just focused on, um, getting help. But there were a few people who saw it happen. I think one of them even helped me up."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it. That could be helpful later on. Now, after the fall, did you seek medical attention?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I went to the hospital that same day. They, um, checked me out and said I had some, like, soft tissue injuries and a concussion. It was really scary."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That does sound scary, Jamie. I can imagine that must have been a lot to deal with. Have you had ongoing treatment for your injuries since then?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I had physical therapy for a few months, and I still have headaches occasionally. It\u2019s, um, frustrating."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m sorry to hear that you\u2019re still dealing with those headaches. It sounds like the injuries have had a significant impact on your life. Have you, um, had any discussions with the grocery store about the incident or reached out to their insurance?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I haven\u2019t, um, really talked to them. I just, like, got the medical bills and everything, but I didn't know what to do next."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s understandable. It's a lot to handle on top of everything else. Did you happen to get any insurance information from the store, like the name of their insurance company?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I think they mentioned something about it. I, uh, have it written down somewhere, but I can\u2019t remember the name right now."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "No problem at all! That\u2019s something we can figure out later. And just to clarify, are you currently working with any other attorneys on this case?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven\u2019t talked to anyone else yet."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, great. That gives us a clean slate to work with. So, just to summarize what we\u2019ve discussed: You slipped and fell in a grocery store in Austin on August 4th, 2020, due to a liquid on the floor without any warnings. You sought medical attention and have experienced injuries, including soft tissue damage and concussions, resulting in ongoing headaches. You\u2019ve not yet contacted any attorneys or the store\u2019s insurance."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, that\u2019s right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Perfect. The next step is that I\u2019ll pass this information along to one of our attorneys who will review your case. They\u2019ll reach out to you to discuss it further and provide guidance on what to do next. It sounds like you have a solid premise for a claim here, especially given the injuries you\u2019ve mentioned."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Okay, um, that sounds good."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! Before we wrap up, do you have any questions about the process or our fees?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I\u2019m not really sure how that works."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Sure! We work on a contingency fee basis, which means we only get paid if you win your case. So, there\u2019s no upfront cost for you. We\u2019ll handle all the legal fees, and you won\u2019t owe us anything unless we\u2019re able to secure compensation for you."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh, that\u2019s a relief!"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m glad to hear that! It\u2019s important to us that you feel comfortable moving forward. Do you have any other questions or concerns?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I think I\u2019m good."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Alright, Jamie. Thank you for sharing your story with me. I\u2019ll make sure all the details are passed along, and someone from our team will get back to you soon. Take care of yourself, and I hope you feel better!"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Thanks, Alex. I appreciate it!"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "You\u2019re welcome!

How can I assist you today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Hi, um, I\u2019m calling about a dog bite incident that happened a little while ago."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Oh no, I\u2019m really sorry to hear that. That sounds very distressing. When did this happen?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "It was, um, on July 27th, I think. Yeah, July 27th."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it. And where did this incident take place?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "It was in Atlanta, Georgia, in my neighborhood park."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thanks for sharing that. Can you tell me what happened during the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I was just walking through the park when this dog, um, it came running up to me. I thought it was friendly at first, but then it, uh, bit my leg."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Oh no! That sounds really painful. Were you able to identify the dog or its owner?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, the owner was there. I think they were, um, shocked too. They apologized and said the dog was usually friendly."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s good that they were there. Did you get their contact information or any insurance details?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I got their phone number and they told me their homeowner\u2019s insurance company. I think it was, um, HomeSafe Insurance or something like that."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "HomeSafe Insurance, okay. That\u2019s helpful. Did you happen to exchange any written information or, like, take photos of the scene or the injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I took a few pictures of my leg after it happened. It was bruised and swollen. I didn\u2019t think to get anything in writing, though."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s understandable. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to think of everything in the moment. Can you describe your injuries a bit more?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, so, um, the bite was pretty deep, and I had to go to the doctor for stitches. They also gave me some antibiotics because they were worried about infection."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Wow, that sounds serious. How are you feeling now? Are you still experiencing any pain or complications?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "It\u2019s, um, getting better, but I still have some pain and it doesn\u2019t look great. I\u2019m worried about scarring too."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s totally valid. Scarring can be something we\u2019ll want to keep in mind moving forward. Have you missed any work or activities because of this?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I had to take a week off from work, and I can\u2019t play soccer yet, which is, like, my favorite thing to do."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I can see how that would be frustrating. It\u2019s important to take care of your health first, though. Have you had a chance to talk to any other attorneys about this incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Nope, you\u2019re the first ones I\u2019m calling. I wanted to, um, see what my options are first."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That makes sense. It\u2019s always a good idea to gather information. Since you mentioned that the dog owner was cooperative, it sounds like there\u2019s a clear liability. It\u2019s great that you have their insurance details too."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I hope that helps."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "It definitely will. Just to clarify, you mentioned the owner had HomeSafe Insurance, right?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, that\u2019s it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Perfect. And I want to reassure you that we work on a contingency fee basis, which means you won\u2019t have to pay anything unless we win your case."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh, that\u2019s good to know!"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m glad to hear that! So, just to summarize what we\u2019ve talked about: You were bitten by a dog in Atlanta on July 27th, you went to the doctor for stitches, and you have some ongoing pain and concerns about scarring. You have the owner\u2019s contact information and their homeowner's insurance is with HomeSafe Insurance."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, that sounds right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! I\u2019ll pass this information to one of our attorneys who will review it and reach out to you soon. Is there anything else you\u2019d like to ask or share with me before we wrap up?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, no, I think that\u2019s everything.

How can I help you today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, hi. Um, I think I might have a case, uh, regarding an accident that happened, um, on June 19th, I think?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, I\u2019m really sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what happened during the accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, so I was at this, uh, like, grocery store in Boston. I was, um, with my friends, and I was, like, looking for cereal or something, and, um, I slipped on some water on the floor."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Oh no, that sounds really painful! Was there any warning sign or, like, anything indicating that the floor was wet?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, no, I don\u2019t think so. Like, there were no signs or anything. It was just, uh, slippery."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I see. That definitely sounds like a situation where the store could be held responsible. Did you get any information from the store or their insurance?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, they gave me a form to fill out, and I think I got the name of their insurance company... It was, uh, something like, uh, SafeGuard or something?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "SafeGuard, got it. That\u2019s helpful. Did you happen to exchange any insurance information with them or, um, get any details about their coverage?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I think they said they\u2019d take care of it? I just filled out the form and, um, they said they\u2019d follow up."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, so it sounds like they were aware of the incident. Now, can I ask about your injuries? What kind of injuries did you sustain from the fall?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, well, I think I hurt my ankle pretty badly. It, like, swelled up and I couldn\u2019t walk for a few days. Um, I might have some, like, bruising too?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really uncomfortable. Have you seen a doctor or gotten any treatment for your injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, um, I went to the ER, but they didn\u2019t do much. Just, like, gave me some ice and told me to rest it?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Gotcha. So, you went to the ER, but it sounds like they didn\u2019t provide a follow-up treatment plan. Have you had any issues with your ankle before this incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, well, I kinda rolled it a few times during, um, soccer practice, like, last year. But it wasn\u2019t like, um, a big deal or anything."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thanks for clarifying that. So, just to confirm, you\u2019ve had some past injuries, but this slip and fall is definitely causing you more pain now, right?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, exactly. It\u2019s, like, way worse now."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Understood. I know this can be a lot to think about. Were you, um, working with another attorney about this incident, or is this your first time reaching out?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, um, I haven\u2019t talked to anyone else."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, that\u2019s good to know. Now, can you tell me how you\u2019re feeling about the whole situation? It\u2019s, um, a lot to deal with, especially being a minor."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, it's kinda stressful. My parents are worried too. Like, they don\u2019t know what to do."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s completely understandable. It\u2019s important to have support during this time. I\u2019ll make sure to pass all this information to one of our attorneys who will review it and get back to you."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, okay."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Just to summarize, you slipped at a grocery store in Boston on June 19th, hurting your ankle. You filled out a report for their insurance, which you believe is SafeGuard, but haven\u2019t talked to another attorney yet. You did visit the ER for your injury, but you\u2019ve had some past ankle issues."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, that\u2019s right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great!

I, um, I wanted to talk about a dog bite incident that happened last year."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Oh no, I'm really sorry to hear that. That sounds very distressing. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, um, it was on April 19th, 2022, in Chicago. I was, like, just walking in my neighborhood when this dog came running out of a yard."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really scary. What kind of dog was it, if you remember?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, it was a big, like, German Shepherd or something. I\u2019m not really sure. It just, um, ran up to me and, uh, bit my leg."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Ouch! That must have hurt a lot. Did you get any medical treatment for your injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I went to the ER. They, um, cleaned the wound and gave me some shots, like, for rabies or something. I, uh, had to go back a couple times for check-ups."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m glad you got the care you needed. And just to clarify, did you take any pictures of the injuries or of the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I took a picture of my leg, but I didn\u2019t get any pictures of the dog or the place where it happened. I didn\u2019t think about that at the time."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s understandable. It can be overwhelming in those moments. Do you happen to know if the dog had an owner, and if so, did you get their information?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, there was a guy, um, he came out. He said the dog was his, and I think he, uh, mentioned he had insurance. I didn't get the details, though."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Did you exchange insurance information with the owner?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I think he said, um, something about having State Farm, but I didn\u2019t get any paperwork or anything from him."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it. So, it sounds like you didn't get any written confirmation, but you do remember the insurance company name. Did you file a police report about the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I didn\u2019t think it was, like, serious enough for that. I just wanted to get to the hospital."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That makes sense. Your health is the priority. Just to follow up on your injuries, have you experienced any long-term effects or ongoing pain since the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, not really long-term. But, like, it hurt for a while, and I had to wear a bandage for a few weeks. I still have a scar, though."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I see. Scarring can be distressing. Have you missed any work or had any other expenses because of this incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I missed a couple of days, but I didn\u2019t have, like, huge expenses. Just the hospital bills, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Yeah, hospital bills can definitely add up. And just to confirm, do you currently have any other attorney representing you for this case?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I don\u2019t. I haven't talked to anyone else."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, that\u2019s good to know. Based on what you\u2019ve shared, it seems like there are some challenges regarding liability since you didn't get a lot of detailed information from the owner. But you do have coverage information, which is a positive aspect."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I guess so. I just want to know what my options are."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Absolutely, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re here for.

I\u2019ll make sure to note that down. Just to summarize, you were bitten by a dog in Chicago on April 19, 2022. You received medical treatment, and while you didn\u2019t get detailed information from the dog owner, you do remember the insurance company being State Farm. You have no other attorney representing you at this time."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, that sounds right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great!

I\u2019m here to help with that. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened with the product?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, so, like, I got this, um, toy for my little brother on the Fourth of July, and it, uh, it kinda broke."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m sorry to hear that. That sounds frustrating. Can you tell me the name of the toy or the brand?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "It was a, um, a remote control car. I think it was, like, ZoomX or something?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it, ZoomX remote control car. And when exactly did this happen? You mentioned it was on the Fourth of July. Was that when it broke?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, it, um, broke the first time we used it, like, right after we unwrapped it, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Oh no, that must have been disappointing. Did anyone get hurt when the toy broke, or was it just a malfunction?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uh, no one got hurt, but, like, my little brother was really upset. He, um, he just started crying 'cause he wanted to play with it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I understand how upsetting that can be, especially for a kid. So, it sounds like there were no injuries, but is there anything else you think might have happened as a result of the toy breaking?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, no, not really. Just, like, a lot of tears."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s understandable. Now, do you happen to know if the toy had any warranty or if there were any safety recalls on it?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I think it had a warranty, but I\u2019m not sure about recalls. I just got it from, like, a local store, so..."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, local store. That\u2019s helpful. Did you keep any packaging or receipts?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I think we still have the box somewhere."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! That could be useful. Now, do you know if the store or the manufacturer has an insurance policy in place for product defects?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I don\u2019t know. I just, like, assumed they had insurance?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s a reasonable assumption. Did you happen to exchange any information with the store or the manufacturer after the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, um, I haven\u2019t contacted them yet. I was just, like, confused about what to do."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s completely understandable. It can be tricky navigating these situations. Just to clarify, you mentioned your brother is a minor. How old is he?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "He\u2019s, um, seven."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thank you for that. Now, have you previously spoken with any other attorneys about this situation, or are we the first ones you\u2019re reaching out to?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, you guys are the first.

Just to recap, you purchased a ZoomX remote control car for your seven-year-old brother on July 4th, 2020, and it broke during its first use.

Then, they took my information and said they\u2019d check the cameras."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s important. It sounds like they acknowledged the situation. Did they mention anything about their safety protocols or if they had a maintenance log for that area?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, no, they didn\u2019t say anything about that. I just, like, told them what happened, and they said they\u2019d follow up."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, thanks for clarifying. Now, can you tell me more about your injuries? How have you been feeling since the accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I, um, I hurt my wrist pretty bad. I think I might\u2019ve sprained it, and it, like, hurts to move it. I also, uh, banged my knee, and it\u2019s swollen."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Ouch! That sounds very painful. Have you seen a doctor or gotten any medical treatment for those injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I went to the ER the same day. They, um, did some X-rays and told me to rest it and gave me some pain meds."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m glad you got checked out. It\u2019s really important to document everything. Are you following up with a primary care physician or a specialist for your wrist and knee?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, yeah. I have an appointment next week with my doctor."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s good to hear! And have you had any other medical issues in the past that we should know about?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Not really. I mean, I, like, I\u2019ve had a few colds, but nothing major."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thanks for sharing that. Now, let\u2019s talk about the insurance. Did you manage to get the grocery store's insurance information or did they mention it?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah! They gave me the name of their insurance company, which is, um, SafeGuard Insurance."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! That\u2019s a solid step. Did they give you any information about how to file a claim or what the next steps would be?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, they just said to, like, reach out to them if I need to. I don\u2019t really know how all this works."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "No worries! That\u2019s what we\u2019re here for. I can help guide you through the process. Just to clarify, have you spoken with any other attorneys about this situation?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven\u2019t. You\u2019re the first ones I\u2019m, um, reaching out to."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Perfect! We\u2019re happy to help you. Now, just to recap: You slipped at a grocery store in Seattle on April 23rd, you injured your wrist and knee, and you\u2019ve already seen a doctor. You reported the incident to the store, and they directed you to their insurance, SafeGuard Insurance."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, that sounds right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! I\u2019ll pass this information along to one of our attorneys who will review it and get back to you soon. They might have some additional questions to make sure we cover everything."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Okay, that sounds good."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Before we wrap up, do you have any other questions about the process or anything else you\u2019d like to discuss?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, just one thing. How do your fees work?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "We work on a contingency fee basis, which means you don\u2019t have to pay us anything upfront. We only get paid if you win your case, so we\u2019re motivated to help you get the best possible outcome."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Okay, that makes sense. Thanks for explaining that!"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Absolutely! I\u2019m glad I could help. You can expect to hear from us soon, and if you think of any more questions later, feel free to reach out."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Thank you so much, Diana!"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "You\u2019re welcome! Take care, and talk to you soon!"}], "outcome_status": "settled", "outcome_value": 135000}

How can I assist you today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Hi, um, I\u2019m calling about an accident I had a while back. I think it was, like, a defective product that caused some issues for me."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m really sorry to hear that. I\u2019d love to help you with this. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Sure! So, it was on November 2nd, 2021, in Miami. I bought this, um, blender from a store, and when I was using it, it just, like, exploded. I ended up cutting my hand on some glass shards."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Oh no, that sounds really painful! I can imagine how unsettling that must have been for you. Did you end up needing medical treatment for your hand?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I went to the ER. They, um, had to stitch it up. I think I have a few scars now, but luckily, it wasn\u2019t super serious."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m glad to hear it wasn\u2019t worse, but those scars can be a constant reminder. Can you tell me a little more about the blender itself? Like, do you remember the brand or model?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "It was a, um, I think it was called, like, BlendMaster. I bought it at a big box store\u2014maybe Target or something like that."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it, BlendMaster. Did you happen to keep the receipt or any information on the warranty for that blender?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I think I still have the receipt somewhere. I\u2019ll have to look for it. But I definitely remember there was a warranty that came with it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Perfect! That will be helpful. Now, regarding the incident, did you manage to take any pictures of the blender after it exploded or of your injury?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I took a couple of photos with my phone. The blender was pretty messed up, and my hand was, like, all bandaged up in the picture."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s great that you documented it. It can be really useful for your case. Now, did you report this incident to the store where you bought the blender or the manufacturer?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I did call the store and told them about it. They, like, took down my information but didn\u2019t really say much. I didn\u2019t contact the manufacturer, though."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thanks for letting me know. It sounds like you did the right thing by reporting it. Did you happen to exchange any information with the store about their insurance, or do you know if they carry liability insurance?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I don't think they gave me any insurance info. They just said they\u2019d look into it, but I haven\u2019t heard back since."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That can be frustrating. It sounds like there might be some liability on their part. Just to clarify, do you have any other injuries besides your hand that you\u2019re concerned about?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I think my hand is the main thing. I mean, it hurt for a while, but it\u2019s mostly just the scars now."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Understood. It\u2019s good that it hasn\u2019t affected you more seriously. Now, have you spoken to any other attorneys about this incident, or are you currently working with anyone?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Nope, you\u2019re the first law firm I\u2019m calling. I just didn\u2019t know what to do after it happened."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I appreciate you reaching out to us. We\u2019re happy to help you navigate this process. Just to give you an overview, we typically work on a contingency fee basis, which means you don\u2019t have to pay any upfront fees. We only get paid if we win your case."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh, that\u2019s good to know. I wasn\u2019t sure how that worked."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Absolutely! So, I\u2019ll summarize what we\u2019ve discussed so far. You had an incident on November 2nd, 2021, in Miami where a BlendMaster blender exploded, resulting in a cut on your hand that required stitches. You\u2019ve documented the incident with pictures and reported it to the store, but you haven\u2019t heard back from them. You don\u2019t currently have another attorney representing you."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, that sounds right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! I\u2019ll pass this information along to one of our attorneys, and they\u2019ll review it and get back to you. Is there a specific way you\u2019d prefer to be contacted\u2014by phone or email?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I think email would be best. It\u2019s easier for me to keep track of things that way."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Perfect! I\u2019ll make a note of that. If you could just provide me with your email address, I\u2019ll ensure it gets to the right person."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Sure! It\u2019s myname@email.com."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thank you! I\u2019ve got that noted down. Is there anything else you\u2019d like to discuss or any questions you have before we wrap up?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I don\u2019t think so. I just hope something can be done about this."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I completely understand, and we\u2019ll do our best to help you. Thank you for trusting us with this matter.

I wanted to talk about a car accident I was in recently."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Hi, Jamie! I'm really sorry to hear that you were in an accident. Can you tell me a little bit about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, it was on November 14th, and I was driving in Chicago. I was, um, stopped at a red light when another car just, like, rear-ended me."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really frustrating. Were you injured in the accident at all?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I think I might have some whiplash. My neck has been hurting since the accident, but I didn\u2019t go to the hospital or anything."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I understand. It\u2019s good that you\u2019re aware of your symptoms, but I encourage you to see a doctor if you can. Just to get everything checked out. You mentioned the other driver hit you from behind\u2014was there anything unusual about the accident that you can recall, like weather conditions or traffic?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Not really. It was a clear day, and traffic was, like, moderate. The other driver seemed kinda distracted, though. They didn\u2019t even hit the brakes until the last second."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That makes sense. Distracted driving can definitely lead to accidents. Did you exchange insurance information with the other driver?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, yeah, we did. They had their insurance card, but I didn\u2019t really look at it closely. I think the company was, uh, State Farm or something like that."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Did you happen to get any details about their coverage or policy number?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I just, like, took a picture of their insurance card, but I didn\u2019t write down any policy numbers. I wasn't really thinking straight at the time."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s completely understandable; accidents can be pretty overwhelming. You mentioned your neck pain\u2014have you noticed any other injuries or issues since the accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Not really. Just the neck pain, but it\u2019s been, like, persistent. Sometimes it gets really stiff, and I can\u2019t turn my head properly."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m sorry to hear that. It\u2019s important to take care of those symptoms. Just to confirm, are you currently working with another attorney on this case?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I\u2019m not. This is my first time reaching out about it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it. Since you\u2019re not currently represented, we can definitely help you explore your options. I want to make sure I have all the details correct. You were stopped at a red light when you were rear-ended, and the other driver seemed distracted. You\u2019ve got some ongoing neck pain but haven\u2019t seen a doctor yet, right?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, that sounds about right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Thanks for confirming that. Now, regarding your vehicle, was there any damage to your car from the accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, there was a little damage to the rear bumper, but it wasn\u2019t, like, super severe or anything. I think it\u2019ll just need a little touch-up."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, so minimal property damage. That\u2019s good to hear, but it\u2019s still important to document everything. Have you thought about getting a repair estimate for your car?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I haven\u2019t done that yet. I was just, like, waiting to see how my neck feels before I deal with the car."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That makes sense. Your health should be the priority. When you\u2019re ready, getting that estimate will be helpful for any potential claims. Just to clarify, do you have any medical insurance that might cover any future doctor visits if you decide to see someone about your neck?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I have insurance through my parents, so I think it should cover it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s good to know. It\u2019s always helpful to have insurance when you need to see a doctor. As for the next steps, I\u2019ll compile all this information and pass it along to one of our attorneys who will review your case and get back to you."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Okay, that sounds good. What happens after that?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "After the attorney reviews your case, they\u2019ll likely reach out to discuss your options, which could include sending a demand letter to the other driver\u2019s insurance company. They\u2019ll also help guide you through any medical evaluations you might need."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Got it. And, um, what are your fees?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great question! We work on a contingency fee basis, which means we only get paid if you win your case or settle. There are no upfront fees for you."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh, that\u2019s a relief. Thanks for explaining that."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Absolutely! We want to make sure you feel comfortable. Is there anything else you\u2019d like to ask me about right now?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, no, I think that covers it. I just really want to make sure I\u2019m handling this the right way."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I completely understand, Jamie. You\u2019re doing the right thing by reaching out and getting information. I\u2019ll make sure to pass all this along to our attorney, and they\u2019ll be in touch soon.

I\u2019m calling about an accident I had recently."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m so sorry to hear that. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, it was on November 17th. I was at this restaurant in Miami, and I slipped on a wet floor. There weren\u2019t any signs warning about the slippery surface, and I fell pretty hard."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really painful! I can imagine how upsetting that must be. Were you hurt in the fall?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I ended up spraining my wrist and bruising my hip. It\u2019s been quite annoying, to be honest."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I can understand that. Have you received any medical treatment for your injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, I went to urgent care the same day. They did some X-rays to make sure nothing was broken and gave me a splint for my wrist."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s good you got checked out right away. Have you had to miss work because of your injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I missed a week of work. I work as a server, so it\u2019s been tough not being able to lift things."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s rough. So, about the accident, do you recall if the restaurant had any insurance? Did you happen to exchange information with them?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I didn\u2019t get the insurance info directly, but the manager told me they\u2019d report it to their insurance. I think they mentioned a company called, um, \u201cSafeguard Insurance\u201d or something like that."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "\u201cSafeguard Insurance,\u201d got it. That\u2019s helpful. Did you notice if there were any surveillance cameras in the restaurant that might have caught the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I did see some cameras. I hope they have footage\u2014they might, um, help prove that it was their fault."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That could definitely be beneficial. It sounds like you feel strongly about the restaurant being liable for your slip. Can you tell me more about why you think it was their fault?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Well, there were other customers who mentioned it was slippery, and I saw a couple of people almost fall too. I think they should have had a sign or something, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That makes sense. If other patrons noticed the condition, it could certainly support your claim. Have you had any prior legal issues in the past that we should be aware of?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, nothing like that. This is my first experience with something like this."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, that\u2019s good to know. Now, regarding your injuries, are you currently experiencing any ongoing pain or issues, or is it mostly just the initial injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "I still have some pain in my wrist, and it hurts when I try to lift anything heavy."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I see. It\u2019s important to keep track of how you\u2019re feeling. Have you thought about whether you want to pursue compensation for your medical bills, lost wages, or any pain and suffering?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I definitely want to get compensated for the medical bills and the time I missed from work."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Absolutely, that\u2019s understandable. Just to clarify, you\u2019re not currently working with another attorney, right?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I\u2019m not. This is all new to me."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great, that helps. So, just to summarize everything we\u2019ve discussed: You slipped and fell at a restaurant in Miami on November 17th, injuring your wrist and hip. You went to urgent care, and you\u2019re still experiencing some pain in your wrist. The restaurant manager mentioned they\u2019d report the incident to their insurance, \u201cSafeguard Insurance,\u201d and there appears to be surveillance footage as well. You want to seek compensation for your medical bills and lost wages, and you haven\u2019t worked with another attorney before."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yes, that sounds right!"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Perfect! I\u2019ll pass this information along to one of our attorneys, and they will review it and get back to you shortly.

Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, so, um, it was on July 10th, 2020, in Austin. I was, like, walking home from my friend\u2019s house and this dog just, um, came out of nowhere, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really scary. Do you remember what kind of dog it was?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Uhh, it was, like, a big dog, I think a pit bull or something."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it. And you mentioned you were just walking home. Did the dog belong to someone in particular, or was it, like, a stray?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, it was, like, a neighbor\u2019s dog. I think it got loose or something."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, so it was a neighbor\u2019s dog. Did you happen to get the owner's name or any information from them?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I think the owner\u2019s name is, like, John or something. I don\u2019t really remember."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "No problem, that happens! Did you exchange insurance information with him?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, um, he said he had insurance, but I don\u2019t know the company or anything."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s okay. It\u2019s good that you got some information. Now, can you tell me what happened when the dog attacked? Were you hurt?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I got bitten on my leg. It was, like, pretty bad. I had to go to the hospital, and they gave me stitches."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m really sorry to hear that. It sounds really painful. How are you feeling now?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, it\u2019s better, but I still have a scar. And, like, I get scared when I see dogs now."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s understandable; it can be tough dealing with that kind of trauma. Did you have any medical expenses related to the treatment?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I think, um, it was a few thousand dollars, but my parents paid for it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "So, your parents handled the medical bills. That makes sense. Have you discussed this incident with any other attorneys, or are you currently being represented by anyone?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, um, we haven\u2019t really talked to anyone else about it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, that\u2019s helpful to know. Now, just to clarify, was there any property damage, like, to your clothing or anything else?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, not really. Just, like, a hole in my pants, but whatever."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Alright, so it was mostly about your injuries. I understand this is a tough situation, but we want to make sure we gather all the facts. Can you tell me how the dog owner reacted during the incident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, he was, like, really freaked out and kept saying sorry. I don\u2019t know if he said anything about, like, taking care of the bills or anything."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s understandable. It sounds like he was concerned at least. Did you notice if there were any witnesses around when the incident occurred?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, um, I think there were a couple of people nearby who saw it happen, but I didn't get their names."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s okay, it\u2019s good to know there were witnesses. They might be able to help support your account of the incident later on. So, just to summarize, you were bitten by your neighbor's dog on July 10th, 2020, in Austin, and you had to go to the hospital for stitches.

{"id": "e9511753-5434-44b4-99dd-faa96aebfbcb", "transcript": [{"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Hi there! Thank you for calling Morgan & Associates. My name is Carlos. How can I assist you today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Hey, um, hi. I\u2019m calling about an accident I was in, um, not too long ago."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I\u2019m really sorry to hear that you were in an accident. Can you tell me a little more about what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, so, um, it was on November 16th, I think? I was driving in Denver, and I got hit by this other car. I can\u2019t remember all the details, though."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "No worries, take your time. So, you were driving\u2014was the other car at fault, or was it a bit of both?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I think they were at fault? They kinda ran a red light or something. I mean, it was really quick, and I was like, \u201cWhoa!\u201d But, yeah, I think they were speeding too."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Got it, so they ran a red light and were speeding. That sounds really scary! Were you able to exchange insurance information with the other driver?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, yeah, I think so. I got their name and insurance, but I can\u2019t remember the company. I think it was, like, State Farm or something?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Okay, State Farm. That\u2019s helpful. Do you know if they had any kind of insurance coverage, like a policy number or anything?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I didn\u2019t get the policy number. I was just kinda in shock, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I totally understand; that\u2019s a common reaction after an accident. Now, can you tell me about your injuries? It\u2019s important for us to know how you\u2019ve been affected."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh, right. So, um, I had a pretty bad whiplash and then, like, my back really hurts. I also, um, had a concussion, I think? I went to the hospital, but I didn\u2019t stay overnight."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That sounds really painful, and I\u2019m glad you got medical attention. Have you been following up with any doctors or physical therapy for your injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, not really. I went to the ER right after the accident, but then I didn\u2019t go back for, like, a week or so. I was feeling better, I guess?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "It\u2019s understandable to feel that way, especially if you\u2019re not in severe pain. But it\u2019s really important to keep getting care if you\u2019re still having issues. Do you have any medical records from your visit?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, I think I got some paperwork from the ER. But, um, I didn\u2019t really know what all of it meant. It was just, like, a bunch of notes."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s okay; we can help with that later. Just make sure to keep any documents you have. Now, I\u2019d like to know if you had any lost wages or other damages because of the accident, like car repairs or anything?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Oh man, yeah. My car is, like, pretty banged up. I haven\u2019t had it fixed yet because I didn\u2019t know what to do. And I missed a couple of days of school, too."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "I see. So you missed school\u2014how many days was that, do you think?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I think it was, like, three or four days? But it\u2019s hard to remember, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Totally understandable. Now, I just want to clarify, have you spoken to or hired another attorney regarding this accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I haven\u2019t talked to anyone else. I didn\u2019t even know I could."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "No problem at all! I\u2019ll make sure to pass this information along to one of our attorneys who can help you out. Just a couple more questions\u2014did you have any witnesses to the accident?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, yeah, there was this guy in a truck behind me. He said he\u2019d back me up if I needed it."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "That\u2019s good to know! Having a witness can really help your case. And one last thing\u2014how are you feeling about everything? Do you feel comfortable with the next steps?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Um, I guess? I just want to make sure I get my car fixed and, like, that I\u2019m okay, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Absolutely, that\u2019s really important. So, to recap: You were in a car accident on November 16th in Denver, where another driver ran a red light and you suffered injuries like whiplash and a concussion. You exchanged information with the other driver, who had State Farm insurance, but you don\u2019t have the policy number. You\u2019ve been to the ER but haven\u2019t followed up much since then. Your car is damaged, and you missed a few days of school. You haven\u2019t spoken to any other attorneys, and you have a witness who can back you up."}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "Yeah, that sounds about right."}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "Great! I\u2019ll pass this information to one of our attorneys, and they\u2019ll review everything and reach out to you soon. Is there anything else I can help you with today?"}, {"speaker": "Caller", "text": "No, I think that\u2019s it. Thanks for your help!"}, {"speaker": "Intake Specialist", "text": "You\u2019re welcome! Take care, and we\u2019ll be in touch soon. Have a good day!"}], "outcome_status": "dropped", "outcome_value": 0}
